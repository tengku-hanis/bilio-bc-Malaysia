abstract={Background: To date, limited data are available on metabolic syndrome prevalence among breast cancer survivors in Malaysia. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and abnormal metabolic syndrome components among breast cancer survivors in East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 95 breast cancer survivors (age 53.7 ± 7.6 years) who have completed main cancer treatments for ≥6 months. Cancer survivors were recruited from two main government hospitals in Kelantan and Terengganu using a purposive sampling method. Results: According to the Harmonized criteria, the metabolic syndrome prevalence was 50.5%. Among those with metabolic syndrome, the most prevalent abnormal metabolic components were triglycerides (91.2%), fasting blood glucose (79.6%) and HDL-c level (78.4%). Except for total cholesterol and LDL-c, all other metabolic syndrome components were significantly different (p < 0.05) between those with and without metabolic syndrome. Significant differences between metabolic syndrome and non-metabolic syndrome groups were found for weight, BMI, waist circumference, body fat percentage and cancer stages (p < 0.05). However, no significant relationship was reported between sociodemographic, clinical parameters and metabolic syndrome among breast cancer survivors in this study. Conclusions: Metabolic syndrome was highly prevalent among breast cancer survivors. It is recommended for health care professionals to closely monitor and improve the triglycerides, blood glucose and HDL-c level of the breast cancer survivors under their care to control the detrimental effect of metabolic syndrome. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Introduction: Women’ sexuality becomes complex after breast cancer diagnosis and sexual health is highly neglected in the management of the illness. Aims: To explore the coping and strategies to overcome sexuality problems and sexual dysfunction among women with breast cancer. Material and Methods: Using the in-depth and photo-elicitation interview methods, this qualitative study following phenomenological analysis was conducted on fourteen married female respondents with breast cancer and had the positive result for female sexual dysfunction (FSD) screened by Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI-6 items) from Kelantan, Malaysia. The interviews data were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and managed in analytic computer software NVivo11 Pro. The transcriptions were analyzed using thematic analysis by referring to the meaning-making theory. Main Outcome Measures: We identified overlapping themes of coping and strategies among women with breast cancer to overcome sexual problems and sexual dysfunction which correspond with meaning-making theory. Results: Three themes have emerged. Women with breast cancer that developed sexuality problem and sexual dysfunction strived to accept the illness using religious belief and conform by altering sexual practices. These individuals positively look for a solution by seeking formal healthcare advice, modify their physical appearance, active discussion with the husband and support from other survivors. A few of them passively struggle with the subject by averting the intimacy and receptive toward polygamy. Conclusion: This study highlighted the various mechanisms that emphasized the pivotal role of religious belief and relationship context as key factors in the coping strategies among women with breast cancer in Malaysia. The finding may not be generalized to other countries. Che Ya SN, Muhamad R, Zain NM, et al. Coping Strategies for Sexual Problems and Sexual Dysfunction Amongst Malay Women With Breast Cancer.

abstract={Purpose: Wider breast cancer (BC) treatment options, short consultation time with physicians, lack of knowledge, and poor coping skills at the time of diagnosis may affect patients’ decisions causing treatment delays and non-adherence. To address this gap, a breast care nurse video orientation program was started. Our aim was to evaluate the video on patients’ knowledge, satisfaction, and treatment adherence. Methods: The video was developed using the BC delay explanatory model. A self-administered pre- and post-survey on 241 newly diagnosed BC patients in University Malaya Medical Center was performed. The Wilcoxon matched paired signed rank test was used to evaluate patients’ pre and post perceived knowledge using a Likert scale 0 to 4 (0 = “no knowledge,” 4 = “a great degree of knowledge”). Treatment adherence among participants were measured after 1-year follow-up. Results: Eighty percent of the patients reported that the video met or exceeded their expectations. In total 80.5% reported that the video was very effective and effective in improving their perspective on BC treatments. There was improvement in perceived knowledge for treatment options (mean scores; M = 0.93 versus M = 2.97) (p < 0.001) and also for perceived knowledge on types of operation, information on chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy, healthy diet, physical activity after treatments, and care of the arm after operation(p < 0.001). In total 89.4%, 79.3%, and 85.9% adhered to surgical, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy recommended treatment, respectively. Conclusion: The video improved patients’ perceived knowledge and satisfaction. The program improved access not only to new BC patients but also the public and found sustainable using the YouTube platform. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={INTRODUCTION: The survival rate of female breast cancer survivors has been reported to be higher than other types of cancer in Malaysia. Nonetheless, breast cancer survivors face new challenges from unwanted side effects of treatment or management such as fatigue, psychological disturbance, or arm swelling, which can lead to the decline of quality of life (QOL). This study aims to adapt the Malay version of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) to evaluate the QOL and to test its reliability and validity in Malaysian breast cancer survivors. METHODS: The Malay version of the FACT-B, with Disabilities of Arms, Shoulders and Hands (DASH), and Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety-Depression Scale (PHQ-ADS) were distributed to female breast cancer survivors which were recruited on a voluntary basis, from cancer support groups based in selected states in Malaysia. Reliability was assessed based on internal consistency (Cronbach's α), whereas concurrent validity was examined by comparing domains in FACT-B with DASH and PHQ-ADS. Finally, total scores of each domain were analysed between lymphedema and without lymphedema groups for known-group validity. RESULTS: A total of 113 breast cancer survivors agreed to participate (response rate = 100%) in the study. Our results showed that the Cronbach's α value for Malay FACT-B is 0.88, and each domain ranged from 0.62 to 0.88. A strong correlation was found between the physical well-being domain of FACT-B with DASH. Meanwhile, the breast cancer scale (BCS) displayed significant correlation with the instrument, Patient Health Questionnaire- Anxiety Depression Scale (PHQ-ADS), indicating that multiple factors including psychological distress were measured in the BCS domain. Furthermore, the instrument was able to detect differences in physical, functional and QOL between participants from lymphedema and without lymphedema groups. CONCLUSION: The Malay version of the FACT-B demonstrated reliable properties and is effective in assessing QOL and can be applied in Malaysian breast cancer survivors.},

abstract={Introduction Proper assessment of unmet supportive care needs of patients with breast cancer and its influencing factors at different treatment intervals will improve the rehabilitation of patients with breast cancer. Therefore, this study aims to determine the prevalence of unmet supportive care needs, changes of needs over time and associated factors during the treatment period. Methods and analysis This multicentre, prospective cohort study will be conducted in three governmental hospitals and one tertiary cancer institute in Penang, Malaysia. Adult women diagnosed with primary or recurrent tumour, node, metastases stage I-IV breast cancer based on pathological biopsy will be eligible for this study. At least 281 samples are required for this study. Participants will undergo follow-up at three time intervals: T1 at breast cancer diagnosis; T2 at 3 months after diagnosis and T3 at 6 months after diagnosis. Patients will complete a set of questionnaires at each time. The primary outcome of this study includes the changes in supportive care needs over three time points, followed by the secondary outcome examining patients' characteristics, coping behaviours and positive psychological components as they affect changes in unmet supportive care needs over time. Ethics and dissemination The study has received ethics approval from the Medical Research and Ethics Committee, Ministry of Health Malaysia (NMRR-19-268-45809 IIR) and the Human Research Ethics Committee of Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM/JEPeM/17100443). The results of the prospective study will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. ©},

abstract={Objective This study investigated relationships among spirituality, hope, and overall quality of life in Muslim women with breast cancer in Malaysia. Method A cross-sectional descriptive design with a convenience sample of 145 Malay patients was used. The mediating role of hope in the relationship between spirituality and quality of life as well as the moderating effect of education level on the spirituality hope link were examined. Results Participants with higher self-reported spirituality reported more hope (b = 6.345, p < 0.001) and higher levels of quality of life (b = 1.065, p < 0.001). Higher educational attainment weakened relationships between spirituality and hope (b = -1.460, p < 0.001). Significance of results The role of advanced education in contributing to lessened hope in relation to spirituality emphasizes the importance of skilled and personalized spiritual counseling in the respective socio-cultural religious context.

abstract={Background and purpose: There are a lack of documentation on psychometric assessments on the Malay version of 14-item Resilience scale (RS-14) in Malaysia. This study was to empirically assess its reliability and validity. Method: A prospective test–retest design was employed on Malaysian women with early breast cancer (N = 105). Data were analyzed using SPSS version 24. Results: The results showed overall Cronbach alpha values were.92 and.93 for test–retest, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values ranged between.62 and.75. This study accepted three factors and two factors for test–retest, respectively. Individual factors showed Cronbach alpha average ranged from.71 to.91. Conclusion: The Malay version RS-14 tool was found to be statistically valid, reliable, and reproducible. It was able to measure resilience level in those women under study. © Copyright 2021 Springer Publishing Company, LLC.},

abstract={Background: The prevalence of breast cancer cases in Malaysia is 1 in every 20 women. Comprehending the risk factors and causation of breast cancer as well as enabling early diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent possible recurrence and fatality. Education on breast cancer plays a pivotal role in raising awareness and overcoming skepticism towards breast examination regimens. The present study aims to compare the awareness and knowledge levels between genders among the local residents of Klang Valley area, Malaysia. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted between October 2018 and January 2019, utilising a random convenient sampling technique. Recruitment of participants was undertaken at population-concentrated locations around the Klang Valley area. A total of 440 volunteers, 198 men and 242 women aged 18 years and above, completed the questionnaire via Google link using several electronic gadgets. Results: Results have revealed that the majority of the residents, regardless of gender, have moderate knowledge or awareness with regard to breast cancer (76.5%), breast cancer symptoms (76.8%), and breast cancer risk factors (74.3%). However, female respondents possessed higher knowledge levels than male respondents with regard to breast cancer symptoms (p = 0.005), whereas a significant difference regarding the knowledge on breast cancer risk factors between genders is absent (p = 0.702). In terms of breast cancer screening methods, more females than males possessed sufficient knowledge about breast self-examination and mammography, constituting 50.8% and 68.2% respectively among the female demographic. Nevertheless, we perceived that the reluctance of breast examination may be due to cultural stigma and self-induced fear. Conclusion: This contemporary research certainly demonstrates an insufficiency of knowledge on breast cancer among the general population irrespective of gender, which further emphasises the relevance of literacy and awareness among the public to help conquer cancer. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Context: Globally, breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women, and adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) is part of its treatment modality, which improves patients’ outcome. However, there are concerns on side effects related to its use, which may affect treatment adherence. Purpose: This study was conducted to explore attitude and practice on using AET among breast cancer patients in Malaysia. Patients and Methods: Postmenopausal breast cancer patients on at least 3 months of AET attending the outpatient oncology clinic at a tertiary care hospital were interviewed. Patients underwent in-depth interviews exploring their attitude and practices while on AET using a semi-structured interview guide. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: There were four main themes for attitude toward the use of AET: 1) benefits of using AET, 2) concerns on taking AET, 3) beliefs on alternative treatment, and 4) beliefs toward the doctor. For practice, six themes were obtained: 1) correct use of AET, 2) appointment adherence, 3) information-seeking behavior, 4) counseling services obtained, 5) experienced side effects of AET, and 6) usage of complementary and alternative medicines. Conclusion: Several themes concerning attitude and practice of breast cancer patients receiving AET were identified, which may be addressed during treatment consultations in clinical practice. © 2021 Saiful Bahri et al.},

abstract={Breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy are at high risk of drug-related problems (DRPs), as it is estimated that around 5-10% of hospital admissions are due to DRPs. Breast cancer man-agement is a leading cause of these DRPs in which the drug toxicity is considered as the main cause that makes DRPs very prevalent. Hence, this study aimed to assess DRPs and their predictors among breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy at the National Cancer Institute (IKN), Malaysia. Breast cancer patients with any stage and type aged ≥ 18 years and receiving chemotherapy between January and De-cember 2017 were included. DRPs were classified according to a modified form of the Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe (PCNE). Statistical analysis was done by Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software version 24. For categorical data, the Chi-squared test was used to determine the associa-tion of patients’ characteristics and the occurrence of DRPs. A p < 0.05 was assumed as statistically signifi-cant among the obtained results. Overall, 100 patients were included in the study. The majority was Malays 59 (59%) and aged between 25-67 years. A total of 157 DRPs were identified in 78 patients, trans-lating to a prevalence of 78%. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were the most common DRPs (47.8%). The most frequent ADR was neutropenia which encountered in 50 patients with prevalence 14.6% of the total ADRs followed by chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) 42 (12.5%). Other DRPs such as drug-drug interactions, drug selection and drug dosing were less common. It was predicted with increas-ing the number of co-morbidities, DRPs were more likely to occur (OR = 2.279, 95%, CI 1.098-4.730, p = 0.027). DRPs were common in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. The predominant propor-tion of DRPs was ADRs. Number of co-morbidities was a predictor of the DRPs among the studied cohort of the patients. © 2021, Colegio de Farmaceuticos de la Provincia de Buenos Aires. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Endocrine therapy (ET) has shown clinical benefts for hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer (BCa) patients. However, it is important to monitor patients’ response to ET. The present study aims to identify the factors associated with disease progression 1 year after ET initiation in a sample of HR-positive BCa patients at Hospital Sultanah Nur Zahirah, a Malaysian public hospital. Patients were identifed from the Cancer Registry of the Terengganu State Health Department. Female patients aged ≥18 years, diagnosed with HR-positive BCa during the period from 2011 to 2014, and who were prescribed with at least one type of ET were included and retrospectively followed-up for 5 years. Disease progression that occurred after 1 year of ET was recorded. Adherence was measured using the medication possession ratio (MPR). Of all 103 BCa patients included in the study, 31.1% had disease progression after 1 year of ET initiation. Late-stage BCa, distant metastasis at diagnosis, MPR value of <0.8 in the frst year of treatment, high comorbidity, and a history of complementary and alternative medicine use were associated with disease progression. Adherence to ET should be emphasized in BCa patients. There is a need to encourage women to seek early treatment for BCa. © 2021 Nurul Sahida Rani et al.

abstract={Background: Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women globally. In low-and middle-income countries, the use of appropriate breast cancer genetics services for screening and personalized treatments is severely lacking. This review is aimed to assess and summarize the reported mutation profiles of Malaysian BC patients. Methods: A literature search was performed in PubMed and Google Scholar from 2002 to 2019 using a set of keywords and MESH terms. Results: Data from 14 eligible studies are presented here. A total of 28 genes were studied in Malaysian BC patients in which 445 genetic alterations (229 deleterious, 209 variants with unknown clinical significance (VUC), and seven protective variants) have been reported, with 73 being novel (16% novel). The frequency ranged from 0.2% to 76% for VUC and 2.1 to 15% for deleterious variations. Only BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, APOBEC3B, and P53 have been associated with BC risk in Malaysian patients. Nine of these studies were conducted using the overlapped source of patients, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to the whole population of Malaysia. Conclusion: Information on the genetic basis of BC in the Malaysian population is scant. Multidisciplinary efforts with appropriate sample selection techniques and study design with multicenter collaboration are needed to address this issue. Out of thirteen high-and moderated-penetrance pathogenic mutations for BC, only five have been linked to Malaysians’ BC susceptibility. The findings from this review is valuable for decision-makers, researchers, and physicians, to enhance the research plans and utility of genetic services for screening and prevention. © 2021, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya.

abstract={Background: The uptake of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) in Asian countries is variable despite being the most effective option for ovarian cancer risk reduction in BRCA mutation carriers. Exploration of factors which may impact the RRSO decision-making of BRCA mutation carriers from Malaysia, a developing country in Southeast Asia, was undertaken. Methods: In-depth interviews with 28 Malaysian BRCA mutation carriers with a history of breast cancer were conducted in addition to observing their RRSO decision-making consultations in the clinic. Results: The decision-making considerations among the carriers were centered around the overarching theme of “Negotiating cancer risk and womanhood priorities,” with the following themes: (1) risk perception, (2) self-preservation, (3) motherhood obligation, and (4) the preciousness of marriage. Cognitive knowledge of BRCA risk was often conceptualized based on personal and family history of cancer, personal beliefs, and faith. Many women reported fears that RRSO would affect them physically and emotionally, worrying about the post-surgical impact on their motherhood responsibilities. Nevertheless, some reported feeling obliged to choose RRSO for the sake of their children. For some, their husband’s support and approval were critical, with emotional well-being and sexuality reportedly perceived as important to sustaining married life. Despite reporting hesitancy toward RRSO, women’s decisions about choosing this option evolved as their priorities changed at different stages of life. Conclusions: Recognizing during clinic encounters with Malaysian women that RRSO decision-making involves negotiating the likelihood of developing cancer with the societal priorities of being a woman, mother, and wife may serve to support their decision-making. © 2021, International Society of Behavioral Medicine.},

funding_text 1={In addition, it is important to note that financial constraint in relation to financial commitment to meet their children needs was a reported barrier for undertaking RRSO. To date, the genetic testing cost in the MyBrCa study has been funded through charity and research grants []. There was a limited access to cancer genetic service in the Malaysian national healthcare system; only two centers are available to offer full genetic services []. This means that the majority of Malaysian BRCA mutation carriers lack access to optimal care and decision support, as there are limited certified genetic counselors and poor awareness about genetic testing for familial cancer in the community [, ]. Nevertheless, the later cost for risk-reduction surgery in MyBrCa was not covered by health insurance, which is similar to other Asian countries []. The cost of RRSO in UMMC, a government funded Ministry of Education hospital was about RM1500 or USD 730 is highly subsidized compared to the private sector. Malaysia has a universal health coverage, access of RRSO in government Ministry of Health hospitals would be heavily subsidized for about RM50 (USD 13), thus making it accessible to the poor and uninsured.},

abstract={Objective: This study aims to determine the prevalence of depression, trait anxiety, and social support among women suspected of breast cancer (BC) and to investigate the association of these factors with the diagnosis of BC. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 745 women who presented with breast symptoms in a university breast clinic in Malaysia. Participants were instructed to respond to self-report questionnaires on depression, trait anxiety, and social support while they were waiting for assessment of their suspected BC. The final diagnoses of these patients were traced one month after examining their medical records. Descriptive statistics were performed to examine the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of all participants. A multiple regression analysis was carried out to determine the association of the abovementioned factors with the diagnosis of BC. Results: The analysis showed that BC was diagnosed in 109 (14.6%), benign breast disease (BBD) in 550 (73.8%), and healthy breast (HB) in 86 (11.5%) women. The prevalence of depression was 53.2% in women with BC, 53.6% in women with BBD, and 60.5% in women with HB prior to diagnosis. The prevalence of trait anxiety was 33%. Mean scores for trait anxiety were 42.2 ± 9.0 and 41.8 ± 9.1 for the BC group and BBD group, respectively. The level of perceived social support was similar in all three groups. Conclusion: We found no significant difference in depression, trait anxiety, and social support among women with newly diagnosed BC, BBD, and HB in women with breast symptoms while undergoing diagnostic evaluation. A longitudinal study is essential to establish the association between chronic mental stress and BC. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={Background: Evidence shows that exposure to passive smoking increases the risk of breast cancer. However, there is a lack of data on the role of serum cotinine level among passive smoker women with breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of serum cotinine level and passive smoking exposure with the risk of breast cancer. Method: We conducted this case-control study on 78 women with newly diagnosed breast cancer and 83 healthy women, aged 21 to 59 years. Neither cases nor controls were ever smokers in their lifetime. The serum cotinine level, as a biological marker of secondhand smoking, was assessed among women exposed to passive smoking. Results: The mean serum cotinine concentrations were higher among cases compared to controls although the difference was not statistically significant (4.6 ± 3.5 ng/mL vs. 2.8 ± 2.2 ng/mL, respectively, P = 0.059). However, serum cotinine significantly increased the risk of breast cancer (OR = 1.22; 95% CI = 1.02, 1.48, P = 0.034). Exposure to passive smoking at home and exposure from a smoker husband increased the risk of breast cancer compared with those with no exposure (OR = 2.17; 95% CI = 1.15, 4.08, P = 0.016; and OR = 2.67; 95% CI = 1.35, 5.29, P = 0.005, respectively). Conclusion: Serum cotinine levels and passive smoking exposure appeared to be independent risk factors associated with the development of breast cancer. © 2021, Shriaz University of Medical Sciences.

abstract={INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer is the most common cancer worldwide. Patients diagnosed with breast cancer face many psychological and social distress that might affect their quality of life and indirectly might affect the disease outcome. Patient-centred education has been found to have a positive influence on the quality of management and anxiety reduction. A one-day workshop involving breast cancer survivor patients was designed as a preliminary step to improve the quality of care provided by oncology nurses in University Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre (UKMMC). The objectives of the workshop were to train the nurses in providing patient-centred education using breast cancer survivor patients and to implement the breast cancer Malaysian Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) recommendation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One-day workshop was designed to meet specific learning outcomes. The patient education program was introduced with special emphasis on a patient-centred approach through the involvement of breast cancer survivor patients. Twenty-one staff nurses and two breast cancer survivor patients have participated in this workshop. The workshop was conducted by a breast cancer surgeon, oncologist, dietitian, family physician, and medical educators. RESULT: Overall, all participants found the workshop was very useful, particularly with the involvement of breast cancer survivor patients. Sixty – two percent of the participants agreed that the objectives of the workshop were met and 76 % of them found the workshop relevant to their work. CONCLUSION: The involvement of breast cancer survivor patients in this workshop was a valuable learning experience that enhanced the patient-centred approach in medical education. © 2021. IMJM.

abstract={Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine the association between anaemia severity and risk factors among breast cancer patients. Methods: A prospective study design was conducted in three different oncology centres in Malaysia where 120 anaemic breast cancer patients (haemoglobin < 12 g/dL) were identified through medical chart review. Patients were followed-up for three cycles of chemotherapy and data such as haemoglobin (Hb) levels and demographic or clinical data were also recorded on each follow-up. Data were analysed using SPSS. Results: The average mean of Hb level of all follow-ups was 10.34 ± 0.73 g/dL. A chi-square and multiple logistic regression analysis revealed a significant strong association between anaemia severity and associated risk factors, i.e., demographic data (age, body mass index [BMI], and marital status), chemotherapy data (dose delay, number of regimens, and type of chemotherapy), and cancer stage. Conclusion: Factors that have a great impact on anaemia severity were identified in which oncologist and healthcare professionals can take them into consideration to reduce the negative effect of anaemia on patients’ health care. Besides, results of such studies could significantly help in developing effective treatment guidelines for this crucial medical issue. © 2020 EManuscript Technologies. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Abnormal malignant growth of breast cells often occurs among women after menopause. But, recently, breast cancer (BC) is increasing in trend among young women, mainly in Asian countries. Breast cancer in young women (BCYW) usually presented with higher grades, advanced stage, and aggressive subtype. The survival of BCYW is poor with a more progressive and higher chance of recurrence and metastasis. Treatment for BCYW usually is more intensive and extensive, which causes more side effects that potentially lead to psychosocial issues. This article review highlights the unique and complex issues of BCYW in Malaysia and around the world. © 2020 UPM Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Introduction: The number of breast cancer survivors in developing Asian countries is still lacking compared to Western countries. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of cancer patients is one of the significant predictors of survival. Hence, this study was conducted to determine HRQoL status among breast cancer survivors of different diagnosis duration in East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia. Methods: Cross-sectional data were collected for 128 breast cancer survivors, aged 37 to 72 years who were recruited by using purposive sampling method at two main government hospitals in Kelantan (n=67) and Terengganu (n=61). The validated European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30) and Breast Cancer Supplementary Measure (EORTC QLQ-BR23) which had been translated into the Malay language were used to measure HRQoL. Independent t-test was used to compare HRQoL status among short term (≤5 years duration since diagnosis) and long term (>5 years duration since diagnosis) breast cancer survivors. Results: Overall, our breast cancer survivors reported good HRQoL, with high scores for global health status, functional status and low symptoms scores. Long term breast cancer survivors had better social functioning compared to short term survivors (p=.038). Nevertheless, there was no significant difference found for other HRQoL status between short and long term breast cancer survivors. Conclusion: Breast cancer survivors in East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia generally experienced good HRQoL. The relatively similar HRQoL status between long-term and short-term survivors indicated a constant HRQoL profile among survivors throughout their survivorship. © 2020 UPM Press.

abstract={Objective: To determine the level of self-efficacy for coping with breast cancer among Malaysian women and its association with socio-demographic and clinical variables. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study involved 168 women diagnosed with breast cancer. The inclusion criteria were age >18 years old, having histologically confirmed breast cancer, and being diagnosed between January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2012. The exclusion criteria were being illiterate and having cognitive impairment. For data collection patients' medical records and the Cancer Behaviour Inventory-Brief (CBI-B) Malay version questionnaire were used. Simple and multiple logistic regression methods were used to analyse the data. Results: Patients' mean (SD) age was 51.4 (10.8) years old. Most of the patients were Malays, married, diagnosed at stage 2 breast cancer (41%), and completed their breast cancer treatment. The mean score for self-efficacy for coping with breast cancer was 83.67 (95% CI: 81.87, 85.47). The significant factors positively correlated with self-efficacy for coping with breast cancer were higher educational background and a higher family income. However, factors such as a family history of breast cancer and breast surgery reduced the mean score of self-efficacy for coping with breast cancer. Conclusion: The mean score of self-efficacy for coping with breast cancer in this study was moderate. Self-efficacy for coping with breast cancer in Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia was not adequate among sufferers and improvement is needed probably by providing education to these patients.},

abstract={Background: Breast cancer remains the leading health concern among females in Malaysia. This study aims to compare the survival time between triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and non-triple negative breast cancer (NTNBC),its proportion and prognostic factor of mortality among TNBC patient. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients with breast cancer treated at Hospital Raja Perempuan Zainab II (HRPZ II) from 1st January 2007 till 31st December 2013. Kaplan Meier survival analysis was used to compare median survival time between TNBC and NTNBC. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to determine prognostic factor of mortality for TNBC including: age, tumor size, lymph node ratio, histological tumor grade, lymphovascular invasion and type of treatment. Results: Out of one hundred fifty one (151) breast cancer patients, thirty two (32) of them were TNBC. The proportion of TNBC and NTNBC incidences made up 21.2% and 78.8% respectively. Overall median survival time of TNBC and NTNBC patients cannot be determined as death occurred in less than 50% of patients (47.7%). However estimated mean and median survival time of TNBC were much lower than NTNBC, which were 29.7 months (95% CI: 21.41, 38.05) versus 34.3 months (95% CI: 28.18, 40.46) and 23.0 months (95% CI: 16.28, 29.78) versus 30.8 months (95% CI: 21.43, 40.14) respectively. There were no significant prognostic factors among TNBC patients whereby the univariate analysis showed that tumor size and lymph node ratio were the significant factors of mortality among all breast cancer patients. Conclusion: Our study concluded that regardless of breast cancer subtypes, the factors that affect overall median survival time were tumor size and lymph node ratio. © 2020 Surgical Society of Northern Greece.

abstract={Objective: Phyllodes tumour (PT) is a rare fibroepithelial neoplasm of the breast that carries a risk of malignancy. Histopathological examination remains a gold standard for diagnosis. The usage of the immunohistochemical markers of Ki67 and p53 acts as a supplement method, particularly for the malignant PT. We aim here to study the expression of these markers in PT and to see their relation to the tumour grading. Methodology: We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study on 57 archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks of PT from the years 2015 to 2018 from two hospitals in East Coast Malaysia. The histopathological examination and immunohistochemical stain for Ki67 and p53 were analysed. Results: There was an association between clinical descriptive data of skin changes, lump size of more than 3 cm, cytological atypia, stromal hypercellularity, mitosis and immunohistochemistry with the clinical diagnosis of PT. Both marked expression of Ki67 and p53 were seen in borderline and malignant PT. Our study showed that in the presence of high mitotic figures, marked expression of Ki67 was only seen in cases of malignant PT. Conclusion: We found a significant association of Ki67 and p53 expressions, high mitosis and other descriptive histopathological features in malignant PT. Further study with larger sample size is recommended to predict tumour grade and prognosis as well as the disease-free survival of the tumour. © 2020 Asian Pacific Organization for Cancer Prevention.},

abstract={OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of a mass media campaign in terms of improving breast cancer (BC) symptoms awareness and screening uptake. DESIGN: Before-and after-study with comparator groups. SETTING: Selangor State, Malaysia. PARTICIPANTS: Malaysian women aged >40 years (n=676) from randomly selected households. INTERVENTION: A culturally adapted mass media campaign (TV, radio, print media and social media). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary endpoint was BC symptoms awareness, which was assessed with the Breast Cancer Awareness Measure precampaign and postcampaign. Secondary outcomes included campaign reach, self-efficacy to notice BC symptoms and clinical outcomes. Clinical breast examination and mammogram screening data were collected from hospitals and clinics. RESULTS: Most participants recognised at least one of the campaign materials (65.2%). The odds of seeing the campaign were lowest for Chinese women (adjusted OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.40) compared with Malays and for women aged >70 years (adjusted OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.94) compared with younger women. Participants who recognised the campaign were significantly more likely to have improved awareness postcampaign compared with non-recognisers particularly for key symptoms such as 'a lump or thickening in your breast' (88.9% vs 62.1%) and 'discharge or bleeding from nipple' (79.7% vs 55.3%). Improvement in symptoms awareness scores was not associated with sociodemographic variables. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation in Malaysia of an evidence-based mass media campaign from the UK that was culturally adapted appeared to lead to improved awareness about some BC symptoms, though various modes of media communication and perhaps other health education approaches may be required to extend the reach to diverse, multiethnic populations and all age groups. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

abstract={Recent studies from high-risk countries such as the US, Denmark and Ireland have shown rising incidence rates of hormone receptor (HR)-positive and falling rates of HR-negative breast cancers (BC). However, it remains unclear whether a similar pattern occurs in low-risk countries. Detailed clinical and risk factor data were collected from 2,977 female invasive BC patients (≥20 years) in Sarawak General Hospital, Malaysia, representing 93% of the population. The population-at-risk was obtained from the Department of Statistics Malaysia. Secular trends in age-standardized incidence rates were assessed using estimated average annual percent changes. Associations between established BC risk factors and tumor subtypes defined by HR or joint human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HR/HER2) status were examined by case–case comparisons using logistic regression. From 2006 to 2015, incidence rates increased for HR-positive cancers by 4.46%/year (95% CI = 2.19–6.78) and decreased for HR-negative cancers by 2.29%/year (95% CI = −4.31 to −0.24). When further stratified by HER2, the most contrasting difference in linear trends was observed between HR+/HER2− and HR−/HER2− subtypes. After controlling for potential confounders, cases with excess body weight (ORoverweight vs. normal = 0.82; 95% CI = 0.69–0.98; ORobese vs. normal = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.48–0.80), later age at first birth (OR≥26 years vs. &lt;23 years = 0.82; 95% CI = 0.66–1.02), nulliparity (ORnulliparous vs. &lt;23 years = 0.74; 95% CI = 0.59–0.94) and never-breastfeeding (ORnever vs. ever = 0.73; 95% CI = 0.55–0.97) were less frequent among HR-negative cases than among HR-positive cases. Diverging incidence trends by HR expression were similar in Sarawak and Western countries, possibly reflecting changes in the prevalence of risk factors with opposing effects by tumor subtypes in low- and high-risk populations. © 2019 UICC},

abstract={Breast cancer is one of the diseases that haunt every woman around the world. It is one of the main killers of women not only in Malaysia, even around the world. Medical diagnosis such as breast cancer is considered a significant but complicated task that needs to be carried out correctly and effectively. In improving the prediction accuracy of breast cancer dataset, this study evaluates the performance of multi-classifier based deep learning approach on datasets. There are five classifiers that are involved like Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), decision tree (J48), random forests (RFs), Naïve Bayes (NB) and Instance Based for K-Nearest neighbor (IBk). These classifiers will be combined and analyzed using deep learning approach. This strategy utilizes models of deep neural network that is a variant of Neural Network but with big approximation to human brain using an advance system compared to a straightforward neural network. The results of combination different classifiers using deep learning approach indicate the highest accuracy than single classification with 96.63% as a combination SMO+RF+IBK+NB. © 2020 SSRG International Journal of Engineering Trends and Technology.

abstract={Background: Lack of physical activity throughout one's lifetime has been associated with obesity and it is also an important risk factor of breast cancer. This study aimed to determine the relationship between objectively measured physical activity and sedentary behaviour with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among breast cancer survivors in the East Coast region of Peninsular Malaysia. Methods: A cross-sectional study involving 83 breast cancer survivors was carried out in two main government referral hospitals in the region. Participants wore the ActivPAL3™ microdevice physical activity monitor for seven consecutive days. The validated European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30) and Breast Cancer Supplementary Measure (EORTC QLQ-BR23) were used to measure their HRQoL. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between objectively measured physical activity and sedentary behaviour with HRQoL. Results: Longer time spent on moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was significantly associated with an improvement of HRQoL (p = 0.039) whereas longer time spent on sedentary behaviour significantly reduced the functioning score (p = 0.005). In addition, prolonged sedentary bouts were also significantly associated with better body image that led to improved HRQoL (p = 0.013). Conclusions: The study findings suggest that an increase in the time spent on MVPA was associated with improved HRQoL while sedentary behaviour was associated with poorer HRQoL among breast cancer survivors. Thus, it is essential to displace sedentary behaviour with MVPA to improve the quality of life of breast cancer survivors. © 2020 The Author(s).},

abstract={Christia vespertilionis, commonly known as 'Daun Rerama', has recently garnered attention from numerous sources in Malaysia as an alternative treatment. Its herbal decoction was believed to show anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects. The present study investigated the cytotoxicity of the extract of root and leaf of C. vespertilionis. The plant parts were successively extracted using the solvent maceration method. The most active extract was further fractionated to afford F1-F8. The cytotoxic effects were determined using MTT assay against human breast carcinoma cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231). The total phenolic content (TPC) of the extracts were determined. The antioxidant properties of the extract were also studied using DPPH and β-carotene bleaching assays. The ethyl acetate root extract demonstrated selective cytotoxicity especially against MDA-MB-231 with the highest TPC and antioxidant properties compared to others (p < 0.05). The TPC and antioxidant results suggest the contribution of phenolic compounds toward its antioxidant strength leading to significant cytotoxicity. F3 showed potent cytotoxic effects while F4 showed better antioxidative strength compared to others (p < 0.05). Qualitative phytochemical screening of the most active fraction, F3, suggested the presence of flavonoids, coumarins and quinones to be responsible toward the cytotoxicity. The study showed the root extracts of C. vespertilionis to possess notable anti-breast cancer effects.},

abstract={Cancer development has been ascribed with diverse genetic variations which are identified in both mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) alterations have been detected in several tumours which include lung, colorectal, renal, pancreatic and breast cancer. Several studies have explored the breast tumour-specific mtDNA alteration mainly in Western population. This study aims to identify mtDNA alterations of 20 breast cancer patients in Malaysia by next generation sequencing analysis. Twenty matched tumours with corresponding normal breast tissues were obtained from female breast cancer patients who underwent mastectomy. Total DNA was extracted from all samples and the entire mtDNA (16.6kb) was amplified using long range PCR amplification. The amplified PCR products were sequenced using mtDNA next-generation sequencing (NGS) on an Illumina Miseq platform. Sequencing involves the entire mtDNA (16.6kb) from all pairs of samples with high-coverage (~ 9,544 reads per base). MtDNA variants were called and annotated using mtDNA-Server, a web server. A total of 18 of 20 patients had at least one somatic mtDNA mutation in their tumour samples. Overall, 65 somatic mutations were identified, with 30 novel mutations. The majority (59%) of the somatic mutations were in the coding region, whereas only 11% of the mutations occurred in the D-loop. Notably, somatic mutations in protein-coding regions were non-synonymous (49%) in which 15.4% of them are potentially deleterious. A total of 753 germline mutations were identified and four of which were novel mutations. Compared to somatic alterations, less than 1% of germline missense mutations are harmful. The findings of this study may enhance the current knowledge of mtDNA alterations in breast cancer. To date, the catalogue of mutations identified in this study is the first evidence of mtDNA alterations in Malaysian female breast cancer patients. © 2020 Omasanggar et al.

abstract={Background: Breast cancer is the leading cause of death among women worldwide. Studies have identified breast density as a controversial risk factor of breast cancer. Moreover, studies found that breast density reduction through Tamoxifen could reduce risk of breast cancer significantly. To date, no study on the association between breast density and breast cancer has been carried out in Malaysia. If breast density is proven to be a risk factor of breast cancer, intervention could be carried out to reduce breast cancer risk through breast density reduction. Purpose: To determine if density of breast is an independent risk factor which will contribute to development of breast cancer. Materials and Methods: A prospective cohort study is carried out in two hospitals targeting adult female patients who presented to the Breast Clinic with symptoms suspicious of breast cancer. Participants recruited were investigated for breast cancer based on their symptoms. Breast density assessed from mammogram was correlated with tissue biopsy results and final diagnosis of benign or malignant breast disease. Results: Participants with dense breasts showed 29% increased risk of breast cancer when compared to those with almost entirely fatty breasts (odds ratio [OR] 1.29, 95% CI 0.38-4.44, P =.683). Among the postmenopausal women, those with dense breasts were 3.1 times more likely to develop breast cancer compared with those with fatty breasts (OR 3.125, 95% CI 0.72-13.64, P =.13). Moreover, the chance of developing breast cancer increases with age (OR 1.046, 95% CI 1.003-1.090, P <.05). In contrast, the density of breast decreases with increasing age (P <.05) and body mass index (P =.051). The proportion of high breast density whether in the whole sample size, premenopausal, or postmenopausal group was consistently high. Conclusion: Although results were not statistically significant, important association between breast density and risk of breast cancer cannot be ruled out. The study is limited by a small sample size and subjective assessment of breast density. More studies are required to reconcile the differences between studies of contrasting evidence. © 2020 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={In view of the planned new edition of the most recent version of the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Clinical Practice Guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of primary breast cancer published in 2015, it was decided at the ESMO Asia Meeting in November 2018, by both the ESMO and the Korean Society of Medical Oncology (KSMO), to convene a special face-to-face guidelines meeting in 2019 in Seoul. The aim was to adapt the latest ESMO 2019 guidelines to take into account the ethnic and geographical differences associated with the treatment of early breast cancer in Asian patients. These guidelines represent the consensus opinions reached by experts in the treatment of patients with early breast cancer representing the oncology societies of Korea (KSMO), China (CSCO), India (ISMPO) Japan (JSMO), Malaysia (MOS), Singapore (SSO) and Taiwan (TOS). The voting was based on scientific evidence, and was independent of both the current treatment practices, and the drug availability and reimbursement situations, in the individual participating Asian countries. © 2020 European Society for Medical Oncology},

abstract={There is a widely held view that breast cancer etiologies vary among women of diverse social-cultural backgrounds. As such, this qualitative study aimed at identifying the various factors associated with the onset of breast cancer symptoms among young Malay women. Thirteen young Malay breast cancer patients in Kuala Lumpur and several selected areas of Selangor were selected through purposive snowballing technique. In relation to this, ethnographic fieldwork employing a qualitative approach was conducted for approximately 10 months. A series of in-depth interviews, phone and online interviews guided by a semistructured interview schedule and participant observation were carried out among the informants of this study. From the thematic analysis of the field notes, it is evident from the present study that young Malay informants had attributed their breast cancer illness to supernatural causes and non-supernatural causes. They strongly believed that saka, spirit attacks, lifestyles, unhealthy food consumption, and hazardous working environments could have contributed to the onset of their breast cancer symptoms. The findings of the present study are imperative particularly for health care providers to understand the healthseeking behaviours of breast cancer patients in the provision of cancer control, particularly in diverse populations like Malaysia. © 2020 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.},

abstract={Women with a positive family history of breast cancer are greatly predisposed to breast cancer development. From January 2007 to December 2016, 1101 patients with a histologically confirmed breast cancer were divided into two groups: patients with and without a positive family history of breast cancer. Variables including age at presentation, ethnicity, tumor size, age at menarche, age at menopause, oral contraceptive pill (OCP) use, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), alcohol intake, smoking, body mass index (BMI), diabetes mellitus, parity, and breastfeeding were recorded. One hundred and fifty-nine out of 1101 (14.4%) of the patients had a family history of breast cancer. There was no significant difference in the incidence of breast cancer among Malays, Chinese, and Indians. Both patient groups presented at a mean age of about 60 years (+FH 60; -FH 61.2 P-value =.218). Significantly higher prevalence of history of benign breast disease (11.3%, P.018), nulliparity (13.2%, P.014), tumor size at presentation of more than 5 cm (47.3%, P 0.001), and bilateral site presentation (3.1%, P 0.029) were noted among respondents with a positive family history of breast cancer compared to those with a negative family history of breast cancer. The odds of having a tumor size larger than 5cm at presentation were almost two times higher in patients with a positive family history as compared to those without a family history (adjusted OR = 1.786, 95% CI 1.211-2.484) (P-value.003). Women in Malaysia, despite having a positive family history of breast cancer, still present late at a mean age of 60 with a large tumor size of more than 5 cm, reflecting a lack of awareness. Breastfeeding does not protect women with a family history from developing breast cancer. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Breast cancer is the most common cancer spread among women worldwide. Whereas many studies have discussed the significance of breast cancer screening among women in various countries, few have attempted to discuss this topic among female school teachers. As teachers educate and communicate with students, this may play an essential role in health education and in promoting healthy behavior, such as breast cancer screening. The primary goal of this study is to develop and implement an educational intervention of breast cancer screening and evaluate its effectiveness among Yemeni female school teachers in Malaysia. This was carried out as per the health belief model. A cluster-randomized controlled trial was conducted among 183 Yemeni female school teachers in twelve schools in Klang Valley, Malaysia. A random assignment of the target schools was made to include them within the intervention or control group. Participants in the intervention group were offered a 90-minute session for one-day educational intervention on breast cancer screening. On the other hand, participants in the control group were offered the same educational materials at the end of the study. Relevant data was collected at baseline, one month following the intervention, and then three- and six-months follow-up assessments. Analysis of such data was done via IBM SPSS software 25.0 by generalized estimating equations (GEE) to assess the differential changes over time. A primary outcome embodied in breast cancer screening practice uptake was expected. Secondary outcomes include the target groupʹs knowledge on and beliefs of breast cancer screening. This study intends to contribute to the credibility and effectiveness of utilizing a theory-based breast cancer screening intervention in order to raise the awareness of women on conducting breast cancer screening. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality among women. The aim of the current study was to find out the level of awareness and belief about breast cancer among women in Selangor, Malaysia. A cross-sectional study was conducted among women living in Selangor aged 18 to 65 years old, with a total of 483 participants. A validated questionnaire regarding awareness and belief was used. The questionnaires consist of 25 questions comprising of socio-demographic, history of other diseases, awareness and belief. The prevalence of poor awareness among women was 63.4%. while the poor level of belief was 84.7%. There was a significant association between awareness and educational background, family history of breast cancer (P=0.001, P=0.032) respectively. The association between awareness and belief was significant (P=0.02). As a conclusion: There is a high level of poor belief and poor awareness among women in Selangor, Malaysia regarding breast cancer. Source of information such as the internet plays a major role in breast cancer prevention, and the majority of them do not know the technique of breast self-examination. More health promotion is needed to target general population through big campaign of awareness. © 2020 Malaysian Public Health Physicians Association.},

abstract={Background: Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in Malaysia, and the incidence of 31.1 per 100,000 population is comparatively higher than other Southeast Asian countries. Diagnosis tends to occur at later stages which may be due, partly, to inadequate knowledge about warning signs and symptoms. Therefore, this study investigated the validity and reliability of a UK-developed measure in the context of assessing women's awareness of breast cancer in Malaysia. Aims: This study aimed to translate, adapt and validate the internationally recognised Breast Cancer Awareness Measure (B-CAM) into the Malay language. Methods: The original B-CAM (Cancer Research UK) was forward and backward translated and content validation was ascertained. Face validity (n=30), test-retest reliability (n=50) and the internal consistency of the B-CAM-M (M for Malay language) were assessed in a community sample of adults (n=251) in 2018. Results: The translated B-CAM-M was validated by an expert panel. The Item-Content Validity Index ranged from .83 to 1.00. The results from the survey (n=251) indicated that the B-CAM-M was well received by Malay-speaking women across the main ethnic groups (85 Malay, 84 Chinese and 82 Indian adults). Cronbach alpha scores for the knowledge about breast cancer symptoms (0.83) and the barriers to healthcare seeking items (0.75) were high. Test-retest reliability (separated by 2-week-interval) with 50 randomly selected participants from the community survey produced intra-class correlations ranging from 0.39 to 0.69. Conclusion: The Malay-version, the B-CAM-M, is a culturally acceptable, valid and reliable assessment tool with which to measure breast cancer awareness among Malay-speaking women. © 2020 Asian Pacific Organization for Cancer Prevention.},

abstract={Background Breast cancer is the fifth most prevalent cause of death among women worldwide. It is also one of the most common types of cancer among Malaysian women. This study aimed to characterize and differentiate the proteomics profiles of different stages of breast cancer and its matched adjacent normal tissues in Malaysian breast cancer patients. Also, this study aimed to construct a pertinent protein pathway involved in each stage of cancer. Methods In total, 80 samples of tumor and matched adjacent normal tissues were collected from breast cancer patients at Seberang Jaya Hospital (SJH) and Kepala Batas Hospital (KBH), both in Penang, Malaysia. The protein expression profiles of breast cancer and normal tissues were mapped by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The Gel-Eluted Liquid Fractionation Entrapment Electrophoresis (GELFREE) Technology System was used for the separation and fractionation of extracted proteins, which also were analyzed to maximize protein detection. The protein fractions were then analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis using LC/MS LTQ-Orbitrap Fusion and Elite. This study identified the proteins contained within the tissue samples using de novo sequencing and database matching via PEAKS software. We performed two different pathway analyses, DAVID and STRING, in the sets of proteins from stage 2 and stage 3 breast cancer samples. The lists of molecules were generated by the REACTOME-FI plugin, part of the CYTOSCAPE tool, and linker nodes were added in order to generate a connected network. Then, pathway enrichment was obtained, and a graphical model was created to depict the participation of the input proteins as well as the linker nodes. Results This study identified 12 proteins that were detected in stage 2 tumor tissues, and 17 proteins that were detected in stage 3 tumor tissues, related to their normal counterparts. It also identified some proteins that were present in stage 2 but not stage 3 and vice versa. Based on these results, this study clarified unique proteins pathways involved in carcinogenesis within stage 2 and stage 3 breast cancers. Conclusions This study provided some useful insights about the proteins associated with breast cancer carcinogenesis and could establish an important foundation for future cancer-related discoveries using differential proteomics profiling. Beyond protein identification, this study considered the interaction, function, network, signaling pathway, and protein pathway involved in each profile. These results suggest that knowledge of protein expression, especially in stage 2 and stage 3 breast cancer, can provide important clues that may enable the discovery of novel biomarkers in carcinogenesis. © 2020 Al-wajeeh et al.

abstract={There are few contributing factors that can be related to breast cancer. The purpose of this research was to study the correlation between breast density, Body Mass Index (BMI) and family's history of breast cancer. The research was carried out at the Women Cancer Detection and Breast Clinic, National Cancer Society, Kuala Lumpur. Two hundred Malaysian women aged between 40 and 60 years volunteered to become subjects in this research. The modality used in this research was mammography. Each subject was given a brief explanation of the research to be carried out and a letter of consent had to be signed before she could participate in this research. Subjects later being asked to answer a questionnaire before their BMI was collected. Subjects were identified via their mammography number. All images were stored in data storage for further analysis. BI-RADS classification was carried out by four experienced radiologists to prevent bias during reporting. BI-RADS breast density classification is divided into four classes: BI-RADS I, BI-RADS II, BI-RADS III and BI-RADS IV. Majority of the subjects have breast density of class BIRADS III (74 subjects), followed by BI-RADS II (60 subjects), BI-RADS IV (34 subjects) and finally BI-RADS I (32 subjects). Overall, majority of subjects have normal BMI class (97 subjects), followed by overweight (59 subjects), obese (42 subjects) and finally underweight (two subjects). BMI are inversely correlated with breast density where (rs=-0.245, ρ&lt;0.01). Only 18 subjects have family history of breast cancer with (rs=0.237, ρ&gt;0.01) and about half of them had lesser dense breast (BI-RADS I=four subjects and BI-RADS II=five subjects, I-RADS III=nine subjects and BI-RADS IV=none). In conclusion, these results did not represent total population as it only include one centre. However, it is suggested for women to go for their mammogram check-up for early detection of breast cancer as every woman are at risk due to overlapping contributing factors related to breast cancer. © 2020 Akademi Sains Malaysia.},

abstract={Background: Measurement of breast cancer burden and identification of its influencing factors help in the development of public health policy and strategy against the disease. This study aimed to examine the variability of the excess mortality of female breast cancer patients in the North East Region of Peninsular Malaysia. Methods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted using breast cancer data from the Kelantan Cancer Registry between 2007 and 2011, and Kelantan general population mortality data. The breast cancer cases were followed up for 5 years until 2016. Out of 598 cases, 549 cases met the study criteria and were included in the analysis. Modelling of excess mortality was conducted using Poisson regression. Results: Excess mortality of breast cancer varied according to age group (50 years old and below vs above 50 years old, Adj. EHR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.31, 4.09; P = 0.004), ethnicity (Malay vs non-Malay, Adj. EHR: 2.31; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.96; P = 0.008), and stage (stage III and IV vs. stage I and II, Adj. EHR: 5.75; 95% CI: 4.24, 7.81; P < 0.001). Conclusions: Public health policy and strategy aim to improve cancer survival should focus more on patients presented at age below 50 years old, Malay ethnicity, and at a later stage. © 2019 The Author(s).},

abstract={Purpose: This observational study aimed to compare the outcome and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) amongst breast cancer patients using Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) and those not using CHM during chemotherapy. Methods: A prospective, non-randomised longitudinal study was conducted in two government integrated hospitals over an 8-month period. Early-stage breast cancer patients who were (1) either already using complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) or not and (2) who were on a regime of 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide were included in the study. Patients who agreed to receive CHM were assigned to receive individualised CHM prescriptions deemed suitable for the individual at a particular time. Those who were not willing to take Chinese herbal medicines (CHM) were assigned to the non-CHM control group. Blood profile and chemotherapy-induced AE were recorded whilst HRQOL assessment was done using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire on first, third, and sixth cycles. Results: Forty-seven patients [32 female vs. 1 male, p = 0.31; mean year of age: 52.2(SD = 7.6), p = 0.28)}] were recruited during the study period. Demographics of both groups were comparable. Fifty percent of respondents reported using some kind of CAM before chemotherapy. Diet supplements (40.6%) were the most common CAM used by the respondents. The study showed that patients using CHM had significantly less fatigue (p = 0.012), nausea (p = 0.04), and anorexia (p = 0.005) during chemotherapy. There were no significant differences in patients’ HRQOL (p = 0.79). There were no AEs reported during the study. Conclusion: The use of CHM as an adjunct treatment with conventional chemotherapy have been shown to reduce fatigue, nausea, and anorexia in breast cancer patients but did not reduce chemotherapy-associated hematologic toxicity. The sample size of this study was not powered to assess the significance of HRQOL between two groups of patients. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Illness experience which was very much a private matter is now increasingly becoming a shared public experience on different public spaces including social media, and other interactive online platform such as personal blogs. Past research has shown that sharing illness experience provides emotional support which surpasses traditional face to face support. In addition, studies also suggest that online sharing of illness experience can be both therapeutic as well as beneficial for cancer patients. Thus, exploring cancer discourse on media is important in enhancing understanding of the nature and characteristics of cancer discourse as constructed on social media. This is especially important in breast cancer illness, in the Malaysian context in which survival rate remains low due to lack of awareness and reluctance to perform screening. Hence, a total of three personal blogs written by breast cancer survivors from Malaysia were examined in this study. Taking a discourse analytic perspective, this study explored the positions taken by bloggers when constructing their illness experience and how these positions are realised through the different discursive strategies and linguistic devices. The findings provide insights into how breast cancer patients position themselves when they share their illness experience online. Understanding this new form of illness sharing provides an avenue to better understand breast cancer patients’ journey and their struggles, and the different roles relevant parties can play in their own health care management and information. © 2019, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Press.

abstract={Introduction: The increasing rate of breast cancer (BC) incidence in Malaysia hints a lack of awareness among Malaysians. One (1) woman out of nineteen (19) is at risk with BC and almost up to fifty percent (50%) of women diagnosed with BC were reported to be under the age of fifty (50). Our main concern is to study the level of awareness among the women on risk factors, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, preventions and treatments. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted exclusively among women in the public with total sample of three hundred and forty six (346), questionnaires were distributed using a simple random technique. Data was collected and analyzed by student T test in SPPS version 20. Results: Our study reveals insufficient awareness on BC. Overall, awareness on risk factors is inadequate, but good knowledge on the importance of family history and diet as risk factors are discovered. Awareness on the cause and clinical manifestations of BC is required for improvement. As for treatment, alternatives especially surgery and chemotherapy are unclear to public, public is remotely unwitting on cessation of smoking to prevent BC at the early stage. Conclusion: Malaysian has spaces for improvement on awareness of BC in terms of risk factors, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment and prevention. Early detection can be achieved with good awareness because it leads to better prognosis and lower mortality. © Author(s) 2019.

abstract={The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between spirituality with quality of life and stress of Malay Muslim breast cancer patients in Malaysia. In addition, the moderating role of education on this relationship was examined. Participants consisted of 145 conveniently selected Malay breast cancer patients. The results indicated that the more spiritual respondents reported a higher level of quality of life and lower level of stress. Moreover, education weakened the relationship between spirituality with quality of life and stress. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Breast cancer is the most common cancer among Malaysian women and roughly one in 19 women at risk of breast cancer in Malaysia. The number of breast cancer cases is steadily growing especially with increasing number of ageing population. The screening practice using mammography needs to be better and potentially efficient. There is always room for advancement when it comes to medical imaging. Early detection of cancer can reduce the risk of deaths for cancer patients. The objective of this paper is to compare the breast cancer detection with two model networks of deep learning technique. The overall process involves image preprocessing, classification and performance evaluation. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of deep learning model network which are VGG16 and ResNet50 to classify between normal tumor and abnormal tumor using IRMA dataset. The result show that VGG16 produces the better result with 94% compared to ResNet50 with 91.7% in term of accuracy. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Ethnopharmacological relevance: Strobilanthes crispus (L.) Blume, locally known in Malaysia as “Pecah kaca” or “Jin batu”, has been traditionally used for treatment of various ailments including cancer. We previously demonstrated that a standardized bioactive subfraction of S. crispus, termed as F3, possessed potent anticancer effects in both in vitro and in vivo breast cancer models. Aim of the study: To investigate the potential of F3 from S. crispus to prevent metastasis in breast cancer. Materials and methods: The antimetastatic effects of F3 were first investigated on murine 4T1 and human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell (BCC) lines using cell proliferation, wound healing and invasion assays. A 4T1-induced mouse mammary carcinoma model was then used to determine the expression of metastasis tumor markers, epithelial (E)-cadherin, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, mucin (MUC)-1, nonepithelial (N)-cadherin, Twist, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and vimentin, using immunohistochemistry, following oral treatment with F3 for 30 days. Results: Significant growth arrest was observed with F3 IC 50 values of 84.27 µg/ml (24 h) and 74.41 µg/ml (48 h) for MDA-MB-231, and 87.35 µg/ml (24 h) and 78.75 µg/ml (48 h) for 4T1 cells. F3 significantly inhibited migration of both BCC lines at 50 μg/ml for 24 h (p = 0.018 and p = 0.015, respectively). Similarly, significant inhibition of invasion was demonstrated in 4T1 (75 µg/ml, p = 0.016) and MDA-MB-231 (50 µg/ml, p = 0.040) cells compared to the untreated cultures. F3 treatment resulted in reduced tumor growth compared to untreated mice (p &lt; 0.01) or mice treated with tamoxifen (p &lt; 0.05). Statistical parameters (absolute count, proportion, intensity and overall scores) indicating upregulation of E-cadherin expression were statistically significant in F3-treated compared to the untreated tumor-bearing mice. Similarly, F3 significantly reduced the expression of MMP-9, MUC1, N-cadherin, Twist, VEGF and vimentin in comparison with the TM (p &lt; 0.01) group Conclusions: Our findings suggest that F3 exerts anti-metastatic effects independent of its cytotoxic effects, and these are supported by the increased expression of E-cadherin concurrent with downregulation of MMP-9, MUC1, N-cadherin, Twist, VEGF and vimentin expression in breast cancer. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Introduction: Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-related protein 1 (IGFBP-rP1) is an important component of the IGF system that regulates insulin resistance-related to tumour development. The aim of this study is to investigate the expression of IGFBP-rP1 among female cancer patients who are known or not known to have Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Materials and Methods: Using a cross-sectional design, cases of ovarian and breast cancer with clinical status of T2DM were selected over a 10-year period in Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia. Immunohistochemical staining for IGFBP-rP1 was performed on paraffin-embedded tissues and the results were correlated with the patient’s demographic and clinicopathological data. Results: A total of 152 breast cancer patients were recruited into the current study with 33.5% (51/152) patients were positive T2DM. Most of the breast cancer patients with T2DM were IGFBP-rP1-negative (66.7%, 34/51). The IGFBP-rP1 expression was significantly difference between breast cancer subjects with and without T2DM (p<0.001). There was no significant association of IGFBP-rP1 expression with data on the demographic and clinicopathological profiles of patients with breast cancer. Meanwhile, positive IGFBP-rP1 expression was evident in 44 out of 108 (40.74%) ovarian cancer cases. Among these cases, 36 were T2DM. In contrast to breast cancer cases, IGFBP-rP1 was mostly expressed among ovarian cancer patients with T2DM (66.7%, 24/36, p < 0.001). However, the -positive expression was not significantly associated with any sociodemographic and clinicopathological features of ovarian cancers. Conclusions: Majority of breast cancer patients with T2DM did not express IGFBP-rP1. In contrast, majority of the ovarian cancer patients with T2DM expressed IGFBP-rP1. © 2019, Malaysian Society of Pathologists. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background: Breast cancer is one of the most common diseases in women worldwide. Many studies have been conducted to predict the survival indicators, however most of these analyses were predominantly performed using basic statistical methods. As an alternative, this study used machine learning techniques to build models for detecting and visualising significant prognostic indicators of breast cancer survival rate. Methods: A large hospital-based breast cancer dataset retrieved from the University Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (n = 8066) with diagnosis information between 1993 and 2016 was used in this study. The dataset contained 23 predictor variables and one dependent variable, which referred to the survival status of the patients (alive or dead). In determining the significant prognostic factors of breast cancer survival rate, prediction models were built using decision tree, random forest, neural networks, extreme boost, logistic regression, and support vector machine. Next, the dataset was clustered based on the receptor status of breast cancer patients identified via immunohistochemistry to perform advanced modelling using random forest. Subsequently, the important variables were ranked via variable selection methods in random forest. Finally, decision trees were built and validation was performed using survival analysis. Results: In terms of both model accuracy and calibration measure, all algorithms produced close outcomes, with the lowest obtained from decision tree (accuracy = 79.8%) and the highest from random forest (accuracy = 82.7%). The important variables identified in this study were cancer stage classification, tumour size, number of total axillary lymph nodes removed, number of positive lymph nodes, types of primary treatment, and methods of diagnosis. Conclusion: Interestingly the various machine learning algorithms used in this study yielded close accuracy hence these methods could be used as alternative predictive tools in the breast cancer survival studies, particularly in the Asian region. The important prognostic factors influencing survival rate of breast cancer identified in this study, which were validated by survival curves, are useful and could be translated into decision support tools in the medical domain. © 2019 The Author(s).},

abstract={Objective: This study was conducted to determine the prevalence and severity of menopausal symptoms and their associated risk factors among postmenopausal breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy. Methods: Postmenopausal breast cancer patients on endocrine therapy were recruited at three hospitals in Malaysia. Presence and severity of menopausal symptoms were determined using the Menopause Rating Scale. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected from medical records. Results: A total of 192 patients participated in this study. Commonly reported symptoms were musculoskeletal pain (59.9%), physical and mental exhaustion (59.4%), and hot flushes (41.1%). Multivariate analyses indicated that increasing number of years after menopause until the start of endocrine therapy was significantly associated with less likelihood of reporting menopausal symptoms and musculoskeletal pain. Patients with primary or secondary education levels reported significantly less menopausal urogenital symptoms compared to patients with a tertiary education level. Patients using aromatase inhibitors were twice as likely to experience musculoskeletal pain compared to patients using tamoxifen (odds ratio, 2.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–4.50; p < 0.05). Conclusion: Menopausal symptoms and musculoskeletal pain are common problems encountered by postmenopausal breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy and should be closely monitored for successful treatment. © 2018, © 2018 International Menopause Society.},

Breast cancer has varying incidence in every country, but genetic factor by family history influence the incidence of breast cancer. This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to determine family history of breast cancer and breast cancer risk between Malays ethnicity in Malaysia and Indonesia. Methods: This meta-analysis was conducted on published research articles on family history of breast cancer and breast cancer risk between Malays ethnicity in Malaysia and Indonesia published between Jan 1999 and Jul 2018 in the online article databases of PubMed, ProQuest and EBSCO. Pooled odds ratios (OR) were calculated with fixed and random-effect models. Publication bias was visually evaluated by using funnel plots and statistically assessed through Egger’s and Begg’s tests. Data were processed using Review Manager 5.3 (RevMan 5.3) and Stata version 14.2 (Stata Corporation). Results: We reviewed 1123 articles. There are 10 studies with number of samples 4511 conducted a systematic review and continued with Meta-analysis of relevant data. The results showed significant association between family history of breast cancer with breast cancer risk in Malays ethnicity in Malaysia and Indonesia (OR = 3.34 [95% CI 2.68-4.15, P<0.00001]). There was not significant publication bias for studies included in family history of breast cancer and breast cancer risk in Malays ethnicity in Malaysia and Indonesia. Conclusion: This analysis confirmed the association of family history of breast cancer and breast cancer risk between Malays ethnicity in Malaysia and Indonesia. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Public Health.

abstract={Background: Advances in medical domain has led to an increase of clinical data production which offers enhancement opportunities for clinical research sector. In this paper, we propose to expand the scope of Electronic Medical Records in the University Malaya Medical Center (UMMC) using different techniques in establishing interoperability functions between multiple clinical departments involving diagnosis, screening and treatment of breast cancer and building automatic systems for clinical audits as well as for potential data mining to enhance clinical breast cancer research in the future. Results: Quality Implementation Framework (QIF) was adopted to develop the breast cancer module as part of the in-house EMR system used at UMMC, called i-Pesakit©. The completion of the i-Pesakit© Breast Cancer Module requires management of clinical data electronically, integration of clinical data from multiple internal clinical departments towards setting up of a research focused patient data governance model. The 14 QIF steps were performed in four main phases involved in this study which are (i) initial considerations regarding host setting, (ii) creating structure for implementation, (iii) ongoing structure once implementation begins, and (iv) improving future applications. The architectural framework of the module incorporates both clinical and research needs that comply to the Personal Data Protection Act. Conclusion: The completion of the UMMC i-Pesakit© Breast Cancer Module required populating EMR including management of clinical data access, establishing information technology and research focused governance model and integrating clinical data from multiple internal clinical departments. This multidisciplinary collaboration has enhanced the quality of data capture in clinical service, benefited hospital data monitoring, quality assurance, audit reporting and research data management, as well as a framework for implementing a responsive EMR for a clinical and research organization in a typical middle-income country setting. Future applications include establishing integration with external organization such as the National Registration Department for mortality data, reporting of institutional data for national cancer registry as well as data mining for clinical research. We believe that integration of multiple clinical visit data sources provides a more comprehensive, accurate and real-time update of clinical data to be used for epidemiological studies and audits. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: Mastectomy rates among women with early breast cancer in Asia have traditionally been high. This study assessed trends in the surgical management of young women with early-stage breast cancer in Asian settings. Survival in women treated with breast-conserving surgery (BCS; lumpectomy with adjuvant radiotherapy) and those undergoing mastectomy was compared. Methods: Young women (aged less than 50 years) newly diagnosed with stage I or II (T1-2 N0-1 M0) breast cancer in four hospitals in Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong in 1990-2012 were included. Overall survival (OS) was compared for patients treated by BCS and those who had a mastectomy. Propensity score analysis was used to account for differences in demographic, tumour and treatment characteristics between the groups. Results: Some 63·5 per cent of 3536 women underwent mastectomy. Over a 15-year period, only a modest increase in rates of BCS was observed. Although BCS was significantly associated with favourable prognostic features, OS was not significantly different for BCS and mastectomy; the 5-year OS rate was 94·9 (95 per cent c.i. 93·5 to 96·3) and 92·9 (91·7 to 94·1) per cent respectively. Inferences remained unchanged following propensity score analysis (hazard ratio for BCS versus mastectomy: 0·81, 95 per cent c.i. 0·64 to 1·03). Conclusion: The prevalence of young women with breast cancer treated by mastectomy remains high in Asian countries. Patients treated with BCS appear to survive as well as those undergoing mastectomy.},

abstract={Objective: This study aims to investigate the public pattern in seeking breast cancer screening information in Malaysia using Google Trends. Methods: The Google Trends database was evaluated for the relative Internet search popularity of breast cancer and screening-related search terms from 2007 to 2018. Results: Result showed downward trends in breast cancer search, whereas mammogram and tomosynthesis search fluctuated consistently. A significant increment was found during Pink October month. Breast cancer search term achieved the highest popularity in the east coast of Malaysia with [x2 (5, N=661) = 110.93, P&lt;0.05], whereas mammogram attained the highest search volume in central Malaysia [x2 (4, N=67) = 18.90, P&lt;0.05]. The cross-correlation for breast cancer was moderate among northern Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak (0.3 ≤ rs ≤ 0.7). Conclusion: Public interest trend in breast cancer screening is strongly correlated with the breast cancer awareness campaign, Pink October. Breast cancer screening should be promoted in the rural areas in Malaysia. © 2019, Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention.},

abstract={Background: Breast cancer is the commonest cancer affecting Malaysian women, accounting for an estimated 30% of all new cancer diagnosed annually. Improvements in breast cancer management have increased the breast cancer survival rate in Malaysia. Clinical and radiological surveillance of the treated breast is vital, as early detection of recurrence improves patient’s survival rate. Discussion: As surgery and radiotherapy alter the appearance of the breasts, distinguishing between recurrence and benign post-surgical changes can be challenging radiologically due to overlapping features. Despite this, differentiation between these two entities is usually possible by recognizing characteristic features of post-treatment sequelae and the evolution of the appearance of the conservatively treated breast by comparing interval findings on serial studies. Conclusion: This pictorial review aims to describe the typical and unusual features of post-treated breasts in the multimodality imaging workup of an established breast care centre in a teaching hospital in Malaysia. © 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Objectives: Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in high-income countries (HICs) suggest that physical, emotional, and psychological needs are important in cancer care. To date, there have been few inconsistent descriptions of PROs in low-income and middle-income Asian countries. Using a standard questionnaire developed by the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM), we compared the perceived importance of PROs between patients in Malaysia and those in HICs and between clusters of Malaysian women. Methods: Breast cancer patients were recruited from three Malaysian hospitals between June and November 2017. We compared the proportion of patients who rated PROs as very important (scored 7-9 on a 9-point Likert scale) between Malaysian patients and data collected from patients in HICs via the ICHOM questionnaire development process, using logistic regression. A two-step cluster analysis explored differences in PROs among Malaysian patients. Results: The most important PROs for both cohorts were survival, overall well-being, and physical functioning. Compared with HIC patients (n = 1177), Malaysian patients (n = 969) were less likely to rate emotional (78% vs 90%), cognitive (76% vs 84%), social (72% vs 81%), and sexual (30% vs 56%) functioning as very important outcomes (P < 0.001). Cluster analysis suggests that older, parous, Malaysian women, who were less likely to have received breast reconstructive surgery, were more likely to rate body image and satisfaction with the breast as very important outcomes. Conclusion: Taking into account the differences in PROs by cultural and socioeconomic settings could improve patient expectation of services and refine the assessment of cancer care outcomes. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a member of the ErbB family of tyrosine kinase receptor proteins that plays important roles in tumour cell survival and proliferation. EGFR has been reported to be overexpressed in up to 78% of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cases suggesting it as a potential therapeutic target. The clinical trials of anti-EGFR agents in breast cancer showed low response rates. However, a subgroup of patients demonstrated response to EGFR inhibitors highlighting the necessity to stratify patients, who might benefit from effective combination therapy that could include anti EGFR-agents. Population variability in EGFR expression warrants systematic evaluation in specific populations. Purpose: To study EGFR alterations and expressions in a multi ethnic Malaysian TNBC patient cohort to determine the possibility of using anti-EGFR combinatorial therapy for this population. Patients and methods: In this study, we evaluated 58 cases of Malaysian TNBC patient samples for EGFR gene copy number alteration and EGFR protein overexpression using fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) methods, respectively. Results: EGFR protein overexpression was observed in about 30% while 15.5% displayed high EGFR copy number including 5.17% gene amplification and over 10% high polysomy. There is a positive correlation between EGFR protein overexpression and gene copy number and over expression of EGFR is observed in ten out of the 48 low copy number cases (20.9%) without gene amplification. Conclusion: This study provides the first glimpse of EGFR alterations and expressions in a multi ethnic Malaysian TNBC patient cohort emphasising the need for the nationwide large scale EGFR expression evaluation in Malaysia. © 2019 Zakaria et al.},

abstract={The “noni” species of Morinda citrifolia L., is using in traditional medicine in the tropical country for over 2000 years. Noni fruit has come from the Morinda citrifolia tree which is called Rubiaceae, and it is from the coffee family. It is a perennial herb whose ripe fruit has a robust butyric acid smell and flavor. Recently scientists have proven that this fruit has antioxidant and antibiotic properties in vitro. An anthraquinone, damnacanthal, is one of the constituents of Morinda citrifolia. It has been demonstrated to have anti-cancer properties. Damnacanthal has low water solubility and low bioavailability. Formulating of damnacanthal into the biodegradable nanocapsule drug delivery system may increase its bioavailability. Various formulations of damnacanthal would be developed to enable the selection of a dosage form that could offer the provision of the anti-cancer bioactive substance with suitable sustained- or controlled release properties. The efficiency of extraction of damnacanthal will be compared using both conventional and traditional method. Both the damnacanthal and an anthraquinone active compounds extracted from noni roots, are currently being studied in the context of anti-cancer study. Soon, the medical values, bioactivities and nutritional of this fruit can be assessed, especially its anti-cancer activity, this fruit extract could play an outstanding economic role in Malaysia and other tropical countries. © 2019 Pakistan Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences.

abstract={Aim: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of neratinib-based therapy in Asian patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Patients & methods: We performed a pooled analysis of seven early-phase studies of neratinib given either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents or trastuzumab in patients with advanced solid tumors. Results: A total of 793 patients with HER2-positive MBC were included in the efficacy analysis (Asia: 271 patients; other regions: 522 patients). The overall response rate in patients from Asia was 66.4% (180/271) and the median progression-free survival was 55.6 weeks. The most common adverse event in patients from Asia was diarrhea (all-grade: 96.3%; grade 3: 27.4%). Conclusion: Neratinib-based therapy is safe and effective in patients with HER2-positive MBC from Asia. © 2019 © 2019 Professor Binghe Xu and coauthors.},

abstract={Breast cancer is one of the five highest in Malaysia and most affected by women. Computer-aided diagram typically used in conjunction with a mammogram to detect breast cancer cells of women. A detection cancerous cell by using image information is a challenge task because of the different intensity distribution in the breast-affected area. This can lead to wrong results and diagnosis. This paper proposes a method to detect cancer cells from a mammogram image. Matrix Laboratory (MATLAB) programming language is used during this entire analysis. Mammogram image is converted to grayscale and then is resized to 600 x 600 pixels. A median filter is used to remove the noises in the image. The thresholds values are investigated from the value-based grayscale histogram. The results clearly demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach of the range threshold value used for segmentation of the cancerous cell. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={Objectives: In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of honey supplementation on the safety profiles of postmenopausal breast cancer patients. Methods: Seventy-two postmenopausal women with stage I, II, or III breast cancer from the Oncology Clinic, Universiti Sains Malaysia Hospital were treated with anastrozole (1 mg/day). Patients were randomly assigned to one of the two groups (n = 36/group): a control group (no honey) and a honey group (20 g/day of honey for 12 weeks). Fasting blood samples were obtained pre- and post-intervention to investigate differences in the haematological, renal, and liver profiles of patients in both the groups. Results: Post-intervention, alanine aminotransferase levels were significantly higher in the control group than in the honey group. In the honey group, white blood cell counts, platelet counts, and creatinine levels were significantly higher following honey supplementation for 12 weeks. Nevertheless, the values were still within normal ranges. Conclusions: The present study suggests that honey supplementation of 20 g/day for 12 weeks is safe and beneficial for postmenopausal breast cancer patients. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Objective: Malays comprise an Asian cultural group reported to have low breast cancer screening uptake rates and poor cancer outcomes. Little is known about Malay cultural factors influencing beliefs and practice of cancer screening and genetic testing. Our study aims to explore health beliefs of Malay women around breast cancer screening and genetic testing. Methods: We conducted focus groups among healthy English-speaking Malay women in Singapore, aged 40 to 69 years, using a structured guide developed through literature review, expertise input and participant refinement. Thematic analysis was conducted to extract dominant themes representing key motivators and barriers to screening and genetic testing. We used grounded theory to interpret results and derive a framework of understanding, with implications for improving uptake of services. Results: Five focus groups (four to six participants per group) comprising 27 women were conducted to theme saturation. Major themes were (a) spiritual and religious beliefs act as barriers towards uptake of screening and genetic testing; (b) preference for traditional medicine competes with Western medicine recommendations; (c) family and community influence health-related decisions, complexed by differences in intergenerational beliefs creating contrasting attitudes towards screening and prevention. Conclusions: Decisions to participate in breast cancer screening and genetic testing are influenced by cultural, traditional, spiritual/religious, and intergenerational beliefs. Strategies to increase uptake should include acknowledgement and integration of these beliefs into counseling and education and collaboration with key influential Malay stakeholders and leaders. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={This paper describes a new possible application of dielectrophoresis (DEP) in breast cancer detection. Breast cancer is one of the most common cancer diseases in Malaysia which makes 17.7% of all cases reported between 2007 and 2011. This research aims to determine the dielectric properties of biophysical and biochemical of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The manipulation of TNBC will be on the detection and enumeration based on polarization factor between permittivity and conductivity of TNBC and suspended medium. The results of analytical modelling prove that there are dynamic changes in the dielectric values, which are the permittivity and conductivity values between TNBC cell and medium when the frequency input value is changed. The findings offer a framework for anticipating TNBC dielectric detection response on the basis of structure-function relationship and suggest that dielectrophoresis lab-on-chip (DLOC) application for TNBC detection and enumeration should be widely used as a surface marker-independent method and provide high precision analysis in cancer progression and treatment effectiveness. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Background: Limited evidence, mostly from studies in Western populations, suggests that the prognostic effects of lifestyle-related risk factors may be molecular subtype-dependent. Here, we examined whether pre-diagnostic lifestyle-related risk factors for breast cancer are associated with clinical outcomes by molecular subtype among patients from an understudied Asian population. Methods: In this population-based case series, we evaluated breast cancer risk factors in relation to 10-year all-cause mortality (ACM) and 5-year recurrence by molecular subtype among 3012 women with invasive breast cancer in Sarawak, Malaysia. A total of 579 deaths and 314 recurrence events occurred during a median follow-up period of ~ 24 months. Subtypes (luminal A-like, luminal B-like, HER2-enriched, triple-negative) were defined using immunohistochemical markers for hormone receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in conjunction with histologic grade. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between risk factors and ACM/recurrence were estimated in subtype-specific Cox regression models. Results: We observed heterogeneity in the relationships between parity/breastfeeding, age at first full-term pregnancy (FFP), family history, body mass index (BMI), and tumor subtype (p value &lt; 0.05). Among luminal A-like patients only, older age at menarche [HR (95% CI) ≥15 vs ≤ 12 years = 2.28 (1.05, 4.95)] and being underweight [HRBMI &lt; 18.5kg/m 2 vs. 18.5-24.9kg/m 2 = 3.46 (1.21, 9.89)] or overweight [HR25-29.9kg/m 2 vs. 18.5-24.9kg/m 2 = 3.14 (1.04, 9.50)] were associated with adverse prognosis, while parity/breastfeeding [HRbreastfeeding vs nulliparity = 0.48 (0.27, 0.85)] and older age at FFP [HR &gt; 30 vs &lt; 21 years = 0.20 (0.04, 0.90)] were associated with good prognosis. For these women, the addition of age at menarche, parity/breastfeeding, and BMI, provided significantly better fit to a prognostic model containing standard clinicopathological factors alone [LRχ2 (8df) = 21.78; p value = 0.005]. Overall, the results were similar in relation to recurrence. Conclusions: Our finding that breastfeeding and BMI were associated with prognosis only among women with luminal A-like breast cancer is consistent with those from previously published data in Western populations. Further prospective studies will be needed to clarify the role of lifestyle modification, especially changes in BMI, in improving clinical outcomes for women with luminal A-like breast cancer. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Background Breast cancer risk factors have been examined extensively in Western setting and more developed Asian cities/countries. However, there are limited data on developing Asian countries. The purpose of this study was to examine breast cancer risk factors and the change of selected risk factors across birth cohorts in Malaysian women. Methods An unmatched hospital based case-control study was conducted from October 2002 to December 2016 in Selangor, Malaysia. A total of 3,683 cases and 3,980 controls were included in this study. Unconditional logistic regressions, adjusted for potential confounding factors, were conducted. The breast cancer risk factors were compared across four birth cohorts by ethnicity. Results Ever breastfed, longer breastfeeding duration, a higher soymilk and soy product intake, and a higher level of physical activity were associated with lower risk of breast cancer. Chinese had the lowest breastfeeding rate, shortest breastfeeding duration, lowest parity and highest age of first full term pregnancy. Conclusions Our study shows that breastfeeding, soy intake and physical activity are modifiable risk factors for breast cancer. With the increasing incidence of breast cancer there is an urgent need to educate the women about lifestyle intervention they can take to reduce their breast cancer risk. © 2018 Tan et al.},

abstract={Objective: To gauge surgical outcome in breast cancer patients with particular reference to overall survival and recurrence free survival among breast cancer patients in Hospital Sultanah Nora Ismail Batu Pahat, Johor, Malaysia. Methods: Patients undergoing ablative breast cancer surgery were identified and clinical records were assessed. Inclusion criteria for enrolment were stage I-IV breast malignancy necessitating resection with or without radiotherapy/ chemotherapy from 2007 to 2013. All individuals had a pre-operative assessment. The post operative assessment period ranged from 1 year to 5 years. Survival distributions were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves. Results: A total of 121 patients were included in this study, with an age range of 28-78 years. Some 98% had undergone local excision/ lumpectomy/ mastectomy with axillary clearance. While 81% of patients underwent chemotherapy, only 69% had radiotherapy. Tumours were oestrogen receptor positive in 58% of cases and progesterone receptor positive in 62%. Local recurrence was detected in 10%. The mean age at diagnosis was 51.3 + 10.4 years. The overall survival analysis was based on 22 deaths among the 121 patients (18.2%). Three-year and five-year survival rates were 87.6% and 78.4%, respectively. Analysis of recurrence-free-survival (RFS) was based on 12 events among 121 patients. The Kaplan-Meier RFS analysis revealed that in 90% of the patients with recurrence, it occurred within 45 months. The five year RFS rate was 84.5%. The median time taken from diagnosis to ablative surgery was 51 days (upper limit of 791 days). Only distant metastasis was a significant factor that impacted on both overall survival and recurrence-free survival (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Overall survival among our breast cancer patients in our facility is comparable to other in other tertiary centres in the country. A trend for earlier detection was noted. © 2018, Asian Pacific Organization for Cancer Prevention.},

abstract={Background: Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers females world-wide. Early detection remains the cornerstone for reducing mortality. Lack of knowledge about breast cancer among women is responsible for the late detection. Material and method: This is a cross-sectional questionnaire-based study conducted on 342 female non-medical university students of different ethnicity. Opportunistic sampling technique used. Results and analysis: 342 students of 19 to 25 years age belonging to the three main ethnic groups in Malaysia (Malay, Chinese and Indian) participated in this study. 94.7% of the participants were single, (69.9%) of the respondents denied having family history of breast cancer. A significant relationship between ethnicity and awareness of breast cancer (p <0.013) was observed with the Chinese ethnicity scoring the highest (62.77%). Difference in BSE practice between ethnicity was also observed (p < 0.001). Among those who practice BSE on a non-regular basis, 58.8% were Chinese, 51.7% Malays and 38.7% were Indians. Conclusion: This study throws light on the urgent need to create awareness about the breast cancer among the university students. © 2018, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

abstract={Objective: The majority of breast cancer patients experience devastating effects of cancer treatments. The impact of cancer treatments, however, could be alleviated through physical exercises. The objective of this study is to determine physical activity among breast cancer patients in association with age, occupational status, marital status, the level of education and financial status. Design: The cross-sectional study was conducted among breast cancer patients from December 2014 to February 2015 in an institution located in the East Coast of Malaysia. Materials and Methods: Data were collected via a self-administered questionnaire. SPSS version 22.0 was used to analyse the data using descriptive and chi-square statistics and the significant level was set at p < .05. Result: Eighty seven breast cancer patients from the day care clinic participated in the study. The levels of physical activity practices among the patients were as follows: 8.1% of them were classified as in the active category, 40.2% were moderately active, while the majority of them were classified as insufficiently active (51.7%). The study also found that the practice of physical activity were associated with the patients' age, their occupational status, their marital status, their level of education (p < .05). Conclusion: The study revealed that the majority of breast cancer patients were insufficiently active in the physical activities that they need to do while, age, occupational status, marital status and educational level have a significant influence on these practices. Thus, it is recommended that the health care providers organize a structured educational programme to educate them on the importance of physical activities to their health. © 2018 Japan Health Sciences University & Japan International Cultural Exchange Foundation.},

abstract={Phyllodes tumor or cystosarcoma phyllodes is a rare fibroepithelial neoplasm which arises from the periductal stroma of the breast. They are classified as benign, borderline, and malignant based on the histologic features. However, all phyllodes tumor (PT) subtypes are regarded as having malignant potential and correct diagnosis is important for surgical management and optimal care. This study is a retrospective review of 76 women diagnosed as PT with highlights on the imaging characteristics, pathology, and surgical treatment over a 7-year period in a tertiary medical center of urban population in Malaysia. There were 45 benign, 16 borderline, and 15 malignant PT. The median age for benign PT was 43, borderline 48.5, and malignant 42 years. The Malay ethnic group constitute 52.6% of cases, with 27.6% and 18.4% in Chinese and Indian ethnic groups, respectively. On mammograms, most benign (64.3%) and 33.3% of malignant PT showed high-density lesions. Calcifications were only seen in 2 benign PT. On ultrasound, 86% of benign PT was well-circumscribed whilst 50.0% of malignant PT had irregular outline. Cystic spaces were seen in 40.0% of malignant and 9.5% of benign PT. 80% of malignant PT lesions were heterogenous. Malignant PT demonstrates tumor heterogeneity, cystic spaces, and posterior acoustic enhancement on ultrasound. Half of malignant PT showed regular borders on ultrasound and appear well circumscribed on mammogram. A total of 46 patients had wide local excision or excision biopsy whilst 30 underwent mastectomy as primary treatment. The majority of the borderline and malignant PTs in our study (75.0% and 85.7% respectively) and only 5 out of the 43 (11.6%) benign PT underwent mastectomy. There were 2 tumor recurrence in the benign PT group and 1 case in the borderline and malignant group respectively. Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).},

abstract={Background: There is a lack of evidence on the effectiveness of multifaceted group-based interventions to improve psychological well-being and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of breast cancer (BCa) survivors in Malaysia. This study is aimed at assessing the effectiveness of such intervention program among the BCa survivors. Materials and Methods: This was a group-based intervention program with pre- and post-test design, carried out among BCa survivors (n=37) who were members of Breast Cancer Support Group Centre, Johor Bahru. A validated self-administered questionnaire was used to assess the impact of the program on psychosocial well-being and HRQOL of the participants. Results: The mean age of BCa survivors was 58.1 years (SD=9.7), with mean age at diagnosis of 49.9 years (SD=9.6). Majority of them were of Chinese ethnicity, married and had secondary level education, but were unemployed. More than 86% of them were diagnosed to have early BCa diagnosis and have since completed the treatment. There were significant decreases in median depression (p=0.001), anxiety (p < 0.001) and stress (p < 0.001) scores at post-intervention. More than 85% of the participants rated themselves to have a good or very good QOL at post-intervention, as opposed to 75.9% at pre-intervention. Significant improvements in several HR-QOL domain scores were seen, with psychological score improving the most (p < 0.001), followed by social relationship (p=0.002) and physical health (p=0.004). Conclusions: Group-based multifaceted intervention can be a viable solution to improve psychosocial well-being of BCa survivors. © 2018 Asian Pacific Organization for Cancer Prevention.},

abstract={Objective: Previous studies showed that offering BRCA mutation testing to population subgroups at high risk of harbouring the mutation may be cost effective, yet no evidence is available for low- or middle-income countries (LMIC) and in Asia. We estimated the cost effectiveness of BRCA mutation testing in early-stage breast cancer patients with high pre-test probability of harbouring the mutation in Malaysia, an LMIC in Asia. Methods: We developed a decision analytic model to estimate the lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) accrued through BRCA mutation testing or routine clinical surveillance (RCS) for a hypothetical cohort of 1000 early-stage breast cancer patients aged 40 years. In the model, patients would decide whether to accept testing and to undertake risk-reducing mastectomy, oophorectomy, tamoxifen, combinations or neither. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) from the health system perspective. A series of sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: In the base case, testing generated 11.2 QALYs over the lifetime and cost US$4815 per patient whereas RCS generated 11.1 QALYs and cost US$4574 per patient. The ICER of US$2725/QALY was below the cost-effective thresholds. The ICER was sensitive to the discounting of cost, cost of BRCA mutation testing and utility of being risk-free, but the ICERs remained below the thresholds. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that at a threshold of US$9500/QALY, 99.9% of simulations favoured BRCA mutation testing over RCS. Conclusions: Offering BRCA mutation testing to early-stage breast cancer patients identified using a locally-validated risk-assessment tool may be cost effective compared to RCS in Malaysia. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Background. The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has increased and little is known on CAM use during the initial period. Therefore, the aim was to determine prevalence of CAM use among newly diagnosed breast cancer patients prior to seeking conventional treatment. Methods. This is a cross-sectional study involved interviewing newly diagnosed breast cancer patients in the University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) using a structured questionnaire. Eligible respondents were interviewedduring a routine clinical visit. Results. A total of 400 patients were interviewed, of whom 139 (34.8%) were CAM users. Dietary supplementation (n = 107, 77.0%) was the most frequently used type of CAM, followed by spiritual healing (n = 40, 28.8%) and traditional Chinese medicine (n = 32, 23.0%). Malay ethnic group (n = 61, 43.9%) was the largest group of CAM users, followed by Chinese (n = 57, 41.0%) and Indian (n = 20, 14.4%). Majority of these CAM users (n = 87, 73.1%) did not disclose the use of CAM to their doctors. Most of them used remedies based on the recommendation of family and friends. Malay ethnicity and patients with 3 or more comorbidities were more likely to use CAM. Conclusion. There is substantial use of CAM among breast cancer patients in UMMC prior to seeking hospital treatment, and the most popular CAM modality is dietary supplements. Since, the majority of CAM users do not disclose the use of CAM to their physicians, therefore health care providers should ensure that those patients who are likely to use CAM are appropriately counseled and advised. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={Purpose: This study aimed, firstly, to assess the determinants of return to work (RTW), secondly, to explore the amount of annual wage loss, and finally, to discover the determinants of wage loss among breast cancer (BC) survivors. Methods: A cross-sectional study design was used in this research. The data was collected via interview using a validated questionnaire. Logistic regression models were developed to discover the significant determinants of RTW and of wage loss among BC survivors. Results: A total of 256 BC survivors were included in this study. The analysis showed that there was a 21% loss of or reduction in mean income within 1 year after diagnosis. The significant predictors of RTW are being a government employee, having reduced wages or wage loss, and if the case had been diagnosed 1 year or more ago. Being a private sector employee and having a late stage of cancer was a barrier to RTW. The main risk factors for reduced wages or wage loss were belonging to the age group of 40–59 years, being of Chinese or Indian ethnicity, having low educational status, and not returning to work. However, belonging to the higher monthly income group (earning > RM 2000) is a protective factor against the risk of reduced wages or wage loss. Conclusions: Non-RTW and wage loss after diagnosis of BC may result in the survivors experiencing a significant financial burden. Assessment of these patients is becoming more crucial because more women participate in the workforce in Malaysia nowadays and because BC is managed using multiple treatment modalities with their consequences could lead to long absences from work. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Background: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is commonly used for cancer- and chemotherapy-related symptoms. Nurses are likely to encounter many CAM users in their practice. Objective: The aims of this study were to assess CAM use and examine the symptom burden of CAM and non-CAM users among patients with breast cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy. Methods: A CAM use questionnaire and the Side-Effect Burden Scale were administered to 546 patients. Complementary and alternative medicine use was categorized as mind-body practices (MBPs), natural products (NPs), or traditional medicine (TM). Results: We identified 386 CAM users (70.7%) in this study. The CAM users reported a higher marginal mean total symptom burden score (40.39 ± 2.6) than non-CAM users (36.93 ± 3.21), although this difference was not statistically significant (P =.09). Triple-modality (MBP-NP-TM) CAM users had a significantly higher marginal mean total symptom burden score (47.44 ± 4.12) than single-modality (MBP) users (34.09 ± 4.43). The risk of having a high total symptom burden score was 12.9-fold higher among the MBP-NP-TM users than among the MBP users. Conclusions: Complementary and alternative medicine use is common among Malaysian patients who are undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer. However, CAM and non-CAM users reported similar symptom burdens, although single-modality use of MBP is likely associated with a lower symptom burden. Implications for Practice: Nurses should keep abreast of current developments and trends in CAM use. Understanding CAM use and the related symptom burden will allow nurses to initiate open discussion and guide their patients in seeking additional information or referrals for a particular therapy. © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

abstract={Background: The rate of contralateral risk-reducing mastectomy (CRRM) is increasing in the West with controversial evidence of improved survival in early breast cancer patients. Although uptake of CRRM in Asia appears low, the trends may rise, and there is currently an urgent need to provide evidence for informed decision-making in clinical practice. This study aims to determine the risk of contralateral breast cancer (CBC) and its associated factors in an Asian setting. Method: A total of 2937 newly diagnosed patients with stage I and stage II breast cancer in University Malaya Medical Centre between Jan 1993 to Dec 2012 were included in the study. Multinomial logistic regression analysis allowing death to compete with CBC as a study outcome was used; patients with unilateral breast cancer who were alive were taken as reference. A stepwise backward regression analysis including age at diagnosis, ethnicity, family history of breast cancer, TNM stage, hormonal receptor status, HER2 status, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormone therapy was conducted. Results: Fifty women developed CBC, over a median follow-up of 6 years. The 5- and 10-year cumulative risk of contralateral breast cancer was 1.0% (95% CI 0.6–1.4%) and 2.8% (95% CI 2.0–3.6%), respectively. Young age at diagnosis of first cancer, positive family history, and stage I disease were independent predictors of CBC. Discussion: The current study suggests that the risk of CBC is very low in a Southeast Asian setting. Any recommendations or practice of CRRM should be reviewed with caution and patients must be counseled appropriately. © 2017, Société Internationale de Chirurgie.},

abstract={Background: Lifestyle factors, such as diet, body weight, and physical activity, are linked to better survival after breast cancer (BC) diagnosis. A high percentage of the Malaysian population is overweight or obese. In addition, studies have shown a disparity in survival among Malaysian women compared with other higher-income countries. The Malaysian Breast Cancer Survivorship Cohort (MyBCC) study aims to study lifestyle factors that affect survival in BC survivors. These are the preliminary findings on the nutritional status of Malaysian BC survivors. Objective: Our aim was to evaluate the nutritional status of BC survivors at 1 year after diagnosis. Design: This was a cross-sectional study of 194 participants from the MyBCC study, recruited within 1 year of their diagnosis. Participants completed a 3-day food diary. Participants: Malaysian women (aged 18 years and older) who were newly diagnosed with primary BC, managed at the University Malaya Medical Center, and able to converse either in Malay, English, or Mandarin were included. Main outcome measures: Dietary intake and prevalence of overweight or obesity among participants 1 year after diagnosis were measured. Statistical analyses performed: Student's t test and analysis of variance or its equivalent nonparametric test were used for association in continuous variables. Results: About 66% (n=129) of participants were overweight or obese and >45% (n=86) had high body fat percentage 1 year after diagnosis. The participants’ diets were low in fiber (median=8.7 g/day; interquartile range=7.2 g/day) and calcium (median=458 mg/day; interquartile range=252 mg/day). Ethnicity and educational attainment contributed to the differences in dietary intake among participants. Higher saturated fat and lower fiber intake were observed among Malay participants compared with other ethnic groups. Conclusions: Overweight and obesity were highly prevalent among BC survivors and suboptimal dietary intake was observed. Provision of an individualized medical nutrition therapy by a qualified dietitian is crucial as part of comprehensive BC survivorship care. © 2018 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics},

abstract={Background: Ardisia crispa Thunb. D.C is used mostly in some parts of the Asian region by traditional practitioners to treat certain diseases associated with oxidative stress and inflammation including cancer and rheumatism. In Malaysia, it is popularly known as 'Mata Ayam' and local traditional practitioners believed that the root of the plant is therapeutically beneficial. Methods: The cytotoxic effect of hydromethanolic extract of A. crispa and its solvents partitions (ethyl acetate and aqueous extracts) against breast cancer cells were evaluated by using MTT assay. The cells were treated with concentration of extracts ranging from 15.63 μg/mL- 1000 μg/mL for 72 h. The quantification of phenolic and flavonoid contents of the extracts were carried out to determine the relationship between of phytochemical compounds responsible for cytotoxic and antioxidative activities. The antioxidant capacity was measured by DPPH and ABTS free radical scavenging assay and expressed as milligram (mg) Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity per 1 g (g) of tested extract. Results: The hydromethanolic and ethyl acetate extracts showed moderate cytotoxic effect against MCF-7 with IC50 values of 57.35 ± 19.33 μg/mL, and 54.98 ± 14.10 μg/mL, respectively but aqueous extract was inactive against MCF-7. For MDA-MB-231, hydromethanolic, ethyl acetate and aqueous extracts exhibited weak cytotoxic effects against MDA-MB-231 with IC50 values more than 100 μg/mL. The plant revealed high total phenolic content, total flavonoid and antioxidant capacity. Conclusion: The response of different type of breast cancer cell lines towards A. crispa extract and its partitions varied. Accordingly, hydromethanolic and ethyl acetate extracts appear to be more cytotoxic to oestrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer than oestrogen receptor (ER) negative breast cancer. However, aqueous extract appears to have poor activity to both types of breast cancer. Besides that, hydromethanolic and ethyl acetate extracts exhibit higher TPC, TFC and antioxidant capacity compared to aqueous extract.

abstract={The main purpose of the paper is to systematically review the common issues and challenges inhibiting breast cancer awareness in Malaysia. Drawing upon journals and database search dealing with breast cancer awareness in Malaysia, 38 articles were retrieved and then analysed using the content analysis method. Issues related to public health management of breast cancer pandemic in Malaysia, its effects and the fundamental principles used in developing and designing cancer control programmes, screening management as well as challenges faced by authorised agencies in promoting breast cancer awareness were studied. Methodology included identification of research streams, and the categorisation of reviewed articles into five main pillars, namely (a) thematic issue/problem statement in the articles; (b) target population; (c) applied methodologies; (d) measurement of dependent variables, and (e) findings that discuss the emerging issue and challenges in promoting breast cancer awareness in Malaysia. It is hoped that the knowledge gained will serve as a significant foundation in designing public health awareness campaigns to cultivate, instil early detection behaviour and ameliorate promotion efforts among public health authorities in Malaysia. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.},

abstract={Context: Rash and oral mucositis are major non-haematological adverse events (AEs) of docetaxel, in addition to fatigue, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, which restrict the use of the drug in cancer therapy. Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) is an acute phase reactant glycoprotein and is a primary carrier of docetaxel in the blood. Docetaxel has extensive binding (>98%) to plasma proteins such as AAG, lipoproteins and albumin. Objective: To study the association between plasma AAG level and non-haematological AEs of docetaxel in Malaysian breast cancer patients of three major ethnic groups (Malays, Chinese and Indians). Materials and methods: One hundred and twenty Malaysian breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel as single agent chemotherapy were investigated for AAG plasma level using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. Toxicity assessment was determined using Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events v4.0. The association between AAG and toxicity were then established. Results: There was interethnic variation of plasma AAG level; it was 182 ± 85 mg/dl in Chinese, 237 ± 94 mg/dl in Malays and 240 ± 83 mg/dl in Indians. It was found that low plasma levels of AAG were significantly associated with oral mucositis and rash. Conclusions: This study proposes plasma AAG as a potential predictive biomarker of docetaxel non-haematological AEs namely oral mucositis and rash. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Background: Breast cancer is the most common malignant disease and the leading cause of cancer death among women globally. This study aimed to determine the median survival time and prognostic factors for breast cancer patients in a North-East State of Malaysia. Methods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted from January till April 2017 using secondary data obtained from the state's cancer registry. All 549 cases of breast cancer diagnosed from 1st January 2007 until 31st December 2011 were selected and retrospectively followed-up until 31st December 2016. Sociodemographic and clinical information was collected to determine prognostic factors. Results: The average (SD) age at diagnosis was 50.4 (11.2) years, the majority of patients having Malay ethnicity (85.8%) and a histology of ductal carcinoma (81.5%). Median survival times for those presenting at stages III and IV were 50.8 (95% CI: 25.34, 76.19) and 6.9 (95% CI: 3.21, 10.61) months, respectively. Ethnicity (Adj. HR for Malay vs non-Malay ethnicity=2.52; 95% CI: 1.54, 4.13; p < 0.001), stage at presentation (Adj. HR for Stage III vs Stage I=2.31; 95% CI: 1.57, 3.39; p < 0.001 and Adj. HR for Stage IV vs Stage I=6.20; 95% CI: 4.45, 8.65; p < 0.001), and history of surgical treatment (Adj. HR for patients with no surgical intervention=1.95; 95% CI: 1.52, 2.52; p < 0.001) were observed to be the statistically significant prognostic factors associated with death caused by breast cancer. Conclusion: The median survival time among breast cancer patients in North-East State of Malaysia was short as compared to other studies. Primary and secondary prevention aimed at early diagnosis and surgical management of breast cancer, particularly among the Malay ethnic group, could improve treatment outcome. © 2018, Asian Pacific Organization for Cancer Prevention.},

abstract={Background Genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 is offered typically to selected women based on age of onset and family history of cancer. However, current internationally accepted genetic testing referral guidelines are built mostly on data from cancer genetics clinics in women of European descent. To evaluate the appropriateness of such guidelines in Asians, we have determined the prevalence of germ line variants in an unselected cohort of Asian patients with breast cancer and healthy controls. Methods Germ line DNA from a hospital-based study of 2575 unselected patients with breast cancer and 2809 healthy controls were subjected to amplicon-based targeted sequencing of exonic and proximal splice site junction regions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 using the Fluidigm Access Array system, with sequencing conducted on a Illumina HiSeq2500 platform. Variant calling was performed with GATK UnifiedGenotyper and were validated by Sanger sequencing. Results Fifty-five (2.1%) BRCA1 and 66 (2.6%) BRCA2 deleterious mutations were identified among patients with breast cancer and five (0.18%) BRCA1 and six (0.21%) BRCA2 mutations among controls. One thousand one hundred and eighty-six (46%) patients and 97 (80%) carriers fulfilled the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for genetic testing. Conclusion Five per cent of unselected Asian patients with breast cancer carry deleterious variants in BRCA1 or BRCA2. While current referral guidelines identified the majority of carriers, one in two patients would be referred for genetic services. Given that such services are largely unavailable in majority of low-resource settings in Asia, our study highlights the need for more efficient guidelines to identify at-risk individuals in Asia. © 2018 Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article).

abstract={Purpose: The objective of this study was to explore the experiences and side-effects of breast cancer patients on chemotherapy in Malaysia. Participants and methods: Purposive sampling of 36 breast cancer patients who have completed chemotherapy and agreed to participate in semi-structured in-depth interviews. A constant comparative method and thematic analysis were used to analyze the interviews. Results: Data were categorized into six main themes: know nothing of chemotherapy; fear of chemotherapy; patients’ beliefs in alternative treatments; symptom management; staying healthy after chemotherapy; and concerns of patients after chemotherapy. Conclusion: Despite complaints about the bad experiences of their chemotherapy-induced side-effects, these patients still managed to complete the entire course of chemotherapy. Moreover, there is a need for a clinical pharmacy service in the oncology clinic setting in Malaysia in order to provide relevant information to help patients understand the chemotherapy received. © 2018 Nies et al.},

abstract={This study aimed to develop and validate a questionnaire on Malaysian students' knowledge and belief toward breast cancer and breast cancer screening. A cross sectional study was conducted among 792 female undergraduate students in selected public universities in Klang Valley, Malaysia. Convergent and discriminant validity tests were used for assessing construct validity of the questionnaire while the internal reliability of the instrument was checked by Cronbach's alpha. The average age of respondents was 22 years (21.77± 1.20). Majority of them were single (96.8%), Malay (91.9%), and Muslim (94.6%). This instrument had a good face and content validity. Cronbach's alpha coefficient for Health Belief Model Scales ranged between 0.73-0.83, indicating acceptable levels of internal consistency. The Kappa value for the knowledge part ranged between 0.52-0.90, also showing acceptable reliability. The developed instrument indicated good construct validity and reliability for Malaysian female students. This instrument can help health care planners and providers to measure levels of knowledge and beliefs of Malaysian women toward breast cancer before planning appropriate intervention. © 2018 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.},

abstract={Purpose Late stage at presentation and poor adherence to treatment remain major contributors to poor survival in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Patient navigation (PN) programs in the United States have led to improvement in diagnostic or treatment timeliness, particularly for women in lower socioeconomic classes or minority groups. To date, studies of PN in Asia have been limited. We aimed to assess the feasibility of PN in a state-run hospital in an LMIC and to report the impact on diagnostic and treatment timeliness for patients in its first year of implementation. Methods We established PN in a dedicated breast clinic of a Malaysian state-run hospital. We compared diagnostic and treatment timeliness between navigated patients (n = 135) and patients diagnosed in the prior year (n = 148), and described factors associated with timeliness. Results Women with PN received timely mammography compared with patients in the prior year (96.4% v 74.4%; P < .001), biopsy (92.5% v 76.1%; P = .003), and communication of news (80.0% v 58.5%; P < .001). PN reduced treatment default rates (4.4% v 11.5%; P = .048). Among navigated patients, late stage at presentation was independently associated with having emotional and language barriers (P = .01). Finally, the main reason reported for delay, default, or refusal of treatment was the preference for alternative therapy. Conclusion PN is feasible for addressing barriers to cancer care when integrated with a state-run breast clinic of an LMIC. Its implementation resulted in improved diagnostic timeliness and reduced treatment default. Wider adoption of PN could be a key element of cancer control in LMICs. © 2018 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.},

abstract={Purpose This study aimed to investigate the relationship between uncertainty in illness and quality of life, and examine the mediating role of coping strategies and mood states in this relationship among breast cancer patients. Methods A convenience sample of 135 Malaysian women with breast cancer completed questionnaires measuring uncertainty in illness, mood states (i.e. anxiety and depression), quality of life, and copying styles. Results The results showed an inverse correlation between uncertainty and quality of life after controlling for the effects of age, cancer stage and time since diagnosis. Moreover, the negative association between illness uncertainty and quality of life was mediated by coping strategies and mood states. Conclusion The findings revealed that breast cancer patients experiencing a high level of uncertainty more likely use avoidant and less likely use active emotional coping strategies which in turn amplifies anxiety and depression and undermines their quality of life. While some interventions to reduce the adverse consequences of uncertainty are recommended, the findings indicated the need for targeted psychological interventions seeking to gradually shift cancer patients' coping strategies from avoidant to active emotional coping. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={This study aimed to investigate the mediating role of coping strategies in the relationship between external locus of control and quality of life among breast cancer patients. A convenience sample of 130 Malaysian breast cancer patients participated in this study. Using a multiple mediation model analysis, we found a negative relationship between powerful others and patients' quality of life and the mediation of active-emotional coping between powerful others and quality of life. The findings indicated the need for early, targeted psychological interventions seeking to encourage externally oriented cancer patients to use more active emotional coping strategies as it may improve their quality of life. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Background: Reproductive factors are associated with risk of breast cancer, but the association with breast cancer survival is less well known. Previous studies have reported conflicting results on the association between time since last childbirth and breast cancer survival. We determined the association between time since last childbirth (LCB) and survival of women with premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancers in Malaysia. Method: A historical cohort of 986 premenopausal, and 1123 postmenopausal, parous breast cancer patients diagnosed from 2001 to 2012 in University Malaya Medical Centre were included in the analyses. Time since LCB was categorized into quintiles. Multivariable Cox regression was used to determine whether time since LCB was associated with survival following breast cancer, adjusting for demographic, tumor, and treatment characteristics. Results: Premenopausal breast cancer patients with the most recent childbirth (LCB quintile 1) were younger, more likely to present with unfavorable prognostic profiles and had the lowest 5-year overall survival (OS) (66.9; 95% CI 60.2–73.6%), compared to women with longer duration since LCB (quintile 2 thru 5). In univariable analysis, time since LCB was inversely associated with risk of mortality and the hazard ratio for LCB quintile 2, 3, 4, and 5 versus quintile 1 were 0.53 (95% CI 0.36–0.77), 0.49 (95% CI 0.33–0.75), 0.61 (95% CI 0.43–0.85), and 0.64 (95% CI 0.44–0.93), respectively; Ptrend = 0.016. However, this association was attenuated substantially following adjustment for age at diagnosis and other prognostic factors. Similarly, postmenopausal breast cancer patients with the most recent childbirth were also more likely to present with unfavorable disease profiles. Compared to postmenopausal breast cancer patients in LCB quintile 1, patients in quintile 5 had a higher risk of mortality. This association was not significant following multivariable adjustment. Conclusion: Time since LCB is not independently associated with survival in premenopausal or postmenopausal breast cancers. The apparent increase in risks of mortality in premenopausal breast cancer patients with a recent childbirth, and postmenopausal patients with longer duration since LCB, appear to be largely explained by their age at diagnosis. © 2017, Société Internationale de Chirurgie.},

abstract={Purpose: This study investigated breast cancer patients’ involvement level in the treatment decision-making process and the concordance between patients’ and physician’s perspectives in decision-making. Participants and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted involving physicians and newly diagnosed breast cancer patients from three public/teaching hospitals in Malaysia. The Control Preference Scale (CPS) was administered to patients and physicians, and the Krantz Health Opinion Survey (KHOS) was completed by the patients alone. Binary logistic regression was used to determine the association between sociodemographic characteristics, the patients’ involvement in treatment decision-making, and patients’ preference for behavioral involvement and information related to their disease. Results: The majority of patients preferred to share decision-making with their physicians (47.5%), while the second largest group preferred being passive (42.6%) and a small number preferred being active (9.8%). However, the physicians perceived that the majority of patients preferred active decision-making (56.9%), followed by those who desired shared decision-making (32.8%), and those who preferred passive decision-making (10.3%). The overall concordance was 26.5% (54 of 204 patient-physician dyads). The median of preference for information score and behavioral involvement score was 4 (interquartile range [IQR] =3-5) and 2 (IQR =2-3), respectively. In univariate analysis, the ethnicity and educational qualification of patients were significantly associated with the patients’ preferred role in the process of treatment decision-making and the patients’ preference for information seeking (p,0.05). However, only educational qualification (p=0.004) was significantly associated with patients’ preference for information seeking in multivariate analysis. Conclusion: Physicians failed to understand patients’ perspectives and preferences in treatment decision-making. The concordance between physicians’ perception and patients’ perception was quite low as the physicians perceived that more than half of the patients were active in treatment decision-making. In actuality, more than half of patients perceived that they shared decision-making with their physicians. © 2017 Nies et al.},

abstract={Purpose: To characterize the spectrum of germline mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2 in population-based unselected breast cancer cases in an Asian population. Methods: Germline DNA from 467 breast cancer patients in Sarawak General Hospital, Malaysia, where 93% of the breast cancer patients in Sarawak are treated, was sequenced for the entire coding region of BRCA1; BRCA2; PALB2; Exons 6, 7, and 8 of TP53; and Exons 7 and 8 of PTEN. Pathogenic variants included known pathogenic variants in ClinVar, loss of function variants, and variants that disrupt splice site. Results: We found 27 pathogenic variants (11 BRCA1, 10 BRCA2, 4 PALB2, and 2 TP53) in 34 patients, which gave a prevalence of germline mutations of 2.8, 3.23, and 0.86% for BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2, respectively. Compared to mutation non-carriers, BRCA1 mutation carriers were more likely to have an earlier age at onset, triple-negative subtype, and lower body mass index, whereas BRCA2 mutation carriers were more likely to have a positive family history. Mutation carrier cases had worse survival compared to non-carriers; however, the association was mostly driven by stage and tumor subtype. We also identified 19 variants of unknown significance, and some of them were predicted to alter splicing or transcription factor binding sites. Conclusion: Our data provide insight into the genetics of breast cancer in this understudied group and suggest the need for modifying genetic testing guidelines for this population with a much younger age at diagnosis and more limited resources compared with Caucasian populations. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC (outside the USA).},

abstract={Background The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in women with T1N0M0 breast cancers is unclear. While gene expression-based prognostic assays may aid management of women with early estrogen receptor (ER) positive tumors, therapeutic decision-making in women with early stage ER negative tumors remains fraught with difficulties. We investigated the association between adjuvant chemotherapy and overall survival in women with T1N0M0, hormone receptor negative breast cancers. Method All newly diagnosed breast cancer patients with node-negative and hormone receptor negative tumors measuring ≤ 2 cm at the University Malaya Medical Centre (Malaysia) from 1993 to 2013 were included. Mortality of patients with and without adjuvant chemotherapy were compared and adjusted for possible confounders using propensity score. Results Of 6732 breast cancer patients, 341 (5.1%) had small (≤2 cm), node-negative and hormone receptor negative tumors at diagnosis. Among them, only 214 (62.8%) received adjuvant chemotherapy. Five-year overall survival was 88.1% (95% confidence interval (CI): 82.0%–94.2%) for patients receiving chemotherapy and 89.6% (95% CI: 85.1%–94.1%) for patients without chemotherapy. Chemotherapy was not associated with survival following adjustment for age, ethnicity, tumor size, tumor grade, HER2 status, lympho-vascular invasion, type of surgery and radiotherapy administration. However, chemotherapy was associated with a significant survival advantage (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.35, 95%CI: 0.14–0.91) in a subgroup of women with high-grade tumors. Conclusion Adjuvant chemotherapy does not appear to be associated with a survival benefit in women with T1N0M0, hormone receptor negative breast cancer except in those with high-grade tumors. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In Malaysia, breast cancer is the most frequent type of disease among women. This study was designed to determine the clinical usefulness of carbohydrate antigen (CA 15-3) and interleukin 2 (IL-2) levels as combined biomarkers in monitoring breast cancer patient's response to chemotherapy. Ethical approval was obtained to recruit patients with histologically confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) attending Oncology Clinic at Advanced Medical and Dental Institute. Whole blood was collected from 10 IDC breast cancer patients' pre and post primary chemotherapy. Plasma was separated from the whole blood to determine the CA 15-3 level and IL-2 level using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) pre and post-treatment. In addition, the histological findings, tumour stage and other patients' data were obtained from the medical record. Findings showed that IL-2 had borderline significant changes between pre- and post-chemotherapy (p = 0.074) whereas for CA 15-3, there was insignificant differences of CA 15-3 level between pre and post-chemotherapy (p > 0.05). It was noted that only CA 15-3 level had significant correlation with tumour size. This study demonstrates that IL-2 level requires further investigation in a larger sample size to correlate its potential use as combined biomarker with CA 15-3 in monitoring response to chemotherapy. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Breast cancer is rated as the most common cancer among women in Malaysia, resulting in 25% of cancer-related deaths in women. However, effective management has been impeded by the burgeoning use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) by these patients. Indeed, women with breast cancer in Malaysia present at a later stage of the disease compared to women from other countries, and a contributing factor has been their preference for CAM treatment prior to seeking conventional therapy. This article explores the impetus behind the use of CAM, and highlights some measures that can be taken to address this issue. Some of the influencing factors noted were patients’ lack of knowledge, sociocultural factors, as well as poor communication with healthcare providers. There needs to be a concerted effort by the key players who are either directly or indirectly involved in the care of these patients to address whatever misconceptions they may have that are related to cancer as well as CAM use. Pharmacists especially, as the drug experts, can play a bigger role in educating these patients on the importance of using evidence-based treatments. © 2017 The Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Australia.},

abstract={Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is widely used among the breast cancer patients in Malaysia. Delays in presentation, diagnosis and treatment have been shown to impact the disease prognosis. There is considerable use of CAM amongst breast cancer patients. CAM use has been cited as a cause of delay in diagnosis and treatments in qualitative studies, however there had not been any confirmatory study that confirms its impact on delays. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the use of CAM among newly diagnosed breast cancer patients was associated with delays in presentation, diagnosis or treatment of breast cancer. This multi-centre cross-sectional study evaluating the time points of the individual breast cancer patients' journey from first visit, resolution of diagnosis and treatments was conducted in six public hospitals in Malaysia. All newly diagnosed breast cancer patients from 1st January to 31st December 2012 were recruited. Data were collected through medical records review and patient interview by using a structured questionnaire. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) was defined as the use of any methods and products not included in conventional allopathic medicine before commencement of treatments. Presentation delay was defined as time taken from symptom discovery to first presentation of more than 3 months. The time points were categorised to diagnosis delay was defined as time taken from first presentation to diagnosis of more than 1 month and treatment delay was defined as time taken from diagnosis to initial treatment of more than 1 month. Multiple logistic regression was used for analysis. A total number of 340 patients participated in this study. The prevalence of CAM use was 46.5% (n = 158). Malay ethnicity (OR 3.32; 95% CI: 1.85, 5.97) and not interpreting symptom as cancerous (OR 1.79; 95% CI: 1.10, 2.92) were significantly associated with CAM use. The use of CAM was associated with delays in presentation (OR 1.65; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.59), diagnosis (OR 2.42; 95% CI: 1.56, 3.77) and treatment of breast cancer (OR 1.74; 95% CI: 1.11, 2.72) on univariate analyses. However, after adjusting with other covariates, CAM use was associated with delays in presentation (OR 1.71; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.78) and diagnosis (OR 2.58; 95% CI: 1.59, 4.17) but not for treatment of breast cancer (OR 1.58; 95% CI: 0.98, 2.55). The prevalence of CAM use among the breast cancer patients was high. Women of Malay ethnicity and not interpreting symptom as cancerous were significantly associated with CAM use. The use of CAM is significantly associated with delay in presentation and resolution of diagnosis. This study suggests further evaluation of access to breast cancer care is needed as poor access may cause the use of CAM. However, since public hospitals in Malaysia are heavily subsidized and readily available to the population, CAM use may impact delays in presentation and diagnosis. © 2017 Mohd Mujar et al.

abstract={Purpose The main objective of this study was to investigate the mediating role of uncertainty in the relationship between locus of control with quality of life, anxiety, and depression. Methods A descriptive and correlational survey was conducted in a private hospital in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. A convenience sample of 118 Malaysian breast cancer patients voluntarily participated in the study and responded to a set of questionnaires including: socio-demographic questionnaire, the short form of Locus of Control Scale, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the Short-Form Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale (SF-MUIS). Results The results revealed that breast cancer patients with higher internal locus of control and lower external locus of control experience a higher quality of life, lower anxiety, and lower depression. Also, uncertainty mediated the relationship between locus of control with quality of life and depression (quasi-significant). Conclusions The findings indicated the need for early, targeted psychological interventions seeking to gradually shift cancer patients' locus of control from external to internal in order to improve their quality of life and reduce their depression and anxiety. Moreover, health care providers by providing relevant information to cancer patients, especially for externally oriented patients, can reduce their uncertainty which in turn would improve their quality of life. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Purpose: To investigate the association between religiosity, perceptions, and knowledge of breast cancer and its treatment among women in Malaysia. Methods: Knowledge and perceptions of breast cancer and its treatment were determined via a questionnaire adapted from previous studies. The Duke Religion Index was used to measure participants’ religiosity. The questionnaires were distributed among women in public areas in Kuala Lumpur. Results: A total of 384 women participated in this study. Non-organisational religious activity (NORA; r = -0.113, p < 0.05) and intrinsic religiosity (IR; r = -0.183, p < 0.01) were significantly negatively correlated with knowledge of breast cancer. NORA (r = 0.115, p < 0.05) and IR (r = 0.229, p < 0.01) were positively, significantly correlated with the perception that patients who underwent treatment for breast cancer can enjoy good quality of life. There was also a significant positive correlation between NORA (r = 0.175, p < 0.05) and IR (r = 0.249, p < 0.01) on the statement that spiritual support improves treatment for breast cancer. IR was the only subscale positively, significantly associated with the perception of choosing breast-conserving surgery as a primary treatment choice (r = -0.111, p < 0.05) and dietary therapies (r = 0.126, p < 0.05) or acupuncture (r = 0.120, p < 0.05) as alternative treatments for breast cancer. Conclusion: Religiosity should be considered in improving women’s knowledge and perceptions of breast cancer and its treatment. © Pharmacotherapy Group, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Benin, Benin City, 300001 Nigeria.

abstract={BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) carries a worse prognosis compared to the other subtypes. There have been conflicting studies that race may impact the prognosis of TNBC patients. We aim to determine the incidence and prognosis of TNBC among the different ethnic races in Singapore, and to determine its associated risk factors for prognosis. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer (BC) from 2005 to 2013 at our tertiary institution were included and divided according to race and subtypes. Demographic and clinical information of non-metastatic TNBC patients were analyzed. Log-rank test, univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to find associated risk factors related with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: Among 1227 BC patients, 129 (10.5%) had TNBC. TNBC patients had the worst OS (P: 0.0005) and DFS (P: 0.0016) among the subtypes. However, variations in race did not have any difference in OS or DFS among TNBC patients. Axillary lymph node involvement, invasive lobular histology, larger tumor size, and the presence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI) were factors associated with both poor DFS and OS among TNBC patients. CONCLUSIONS: Racial variation did not have any impact on the prognosis of the TNBC. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Background: Anxiety is recognized as a normal psychological reaction of those caring for cancer patients. However, anxiety disorders in caregivers may interfere with their care-giving role and require further clinical attention. Objectives: To determine the prevalence and associated factors of anxiety disorders among caregivers of breast cancer patients receiving oncologic treatment in Kuala Lumpur Hospital. Methodology: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 130 caregiver-patient dyads, recruited by non-random sampling at Kuala Lumpur Hospital. Data were collected in 2 stages: 1) the caregivers were screened for psychological distress using the Depression, Anxiety, Stress, Scale (DASS-21) while other related factors for the patients and their caregivers were obtained; 2) the identified distressed caregivers (n = 64) were then administered the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) to diagnose anxiety disorders. Results: A total of 11.5% (n = 15) of the caregivers reported suffering from anxiety disorders. Bivariate analysis found duration of caregiving (OR = 3.31; CI = 2.21-11.93), shared caregiving (OR = 4.07; CI = 1.34-12.36), and patients' treatment type (OR = 3.42; CI = 1.92-12.76) were significantly associated with anxiety disorders (p value < 0.05), with shared caregiving and patient's treatment type remaining significant using logistic regression (p value < 0.05, R2 = 0.255). Conclusions: Every one in ten of the caregivers in this study had a diagnosable anxiety disorder, associated with certain care-giving factors and patients' treatment. This should alert clinicians to such risk and indicates psychological support needs for family caregivers.},

abstract={The purpose of the study was to determine the level of knowledge and beliefs about female breast cancer among male students. A cross-sectional study involving 460 male students of a private university selected by convenient sampling was conducted using self-administered questionnaires that consists of socio-demographic details as well as knowledge and beliefs about female breast cancer. The prevalence of good knowledge was only 45.2%, there was a significant association between level of knowledge and age, course of study (p=0.02 and < 0.001, respectively). The prevalence of poor belief was 72.6% and the main source of information was the media (84.1 %). There was no significant association between beliefs about female breast cancer and family income, mother's education and race. However, there was a significant association between beliefs about female breast cancer and age, course of study and father's education. As a conclusion, the knowledge and beliefs about female breast cancer among the male students was very poor. More education and awareness need to be emphasized; especially the media was the most common source of information in our study.},

abstract={A balanced dietary intake plays an important role in the prognosis of breast cancer and is one of the modifiable factors in preventing cancer recurrence. This study aims to determine the dietary intake among breast cancer survivors in East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia. A total of 125 breast cancer survivors, aged 37 to 72 years, with mean duration of survivorship of 6.1 ± 3.9 years were recruited from two main referral hospitals in Terengganu and Kelantan. Majority of the respondents were Malay (94.4%) with a mean BMI of 27.7 ± 5.07 kg/m2, and were diagnosed with stage II cancer (66.0%). Dietary intake was estimated using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The results show that the mean daily intake of energy was 1764 ± 378 kcal/day, protein was 72.38 ± 33.6 g/day (16.5% of energy), carbohydrate was 243.0 ± 62.2 g/day (55% of energy) and fat was 55.8 ± 15.6 g/day (28% of energy). Overall, breast cancer survivors in this study had an adequate daily intake of vitamins and minerals according to Malaysian Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNI) except for dietary fibre (10.6 ± 4.2 g/day), monounsaturated fatty acids (20.7 ± 5.7 g/day), polyunsaturated fatty acids (8.0 ± 2.2 g/day), calcium (561.0 ± 257.1 mg/day), iron (18.3 ± 7.2 mg/day) and potassium (1813.4 ± 531.1 mg/day) which was lower than the recommendation. Meanwhile, intake of sodium (2592 ± 1697 mg/day), protein (80.4 ± 33.6 g/day), saturated fatty acids (26.9 ± 14.2 g/day), vitamin B2 (1.9 ± 1.1 mg/day) and vitamin C (151.1 ± 149.3 mg/day) exceeded the recommendation by 135.0%, 139.0%, 166.9%, 154.6% and 152.0%, respectively. There was no significant difference in dietary intake between cancer survivors who were diagnosed in the past five years and those who were diagnosed more than five years ago (p &gt; 0.05) except for fat (p &lt; 0.001), saturated fatty acid (p=0.006), monounsaturated fatty acid (p=0.005) and polyunsaturated fatty acid (p=0.003). As a conclusion, breast cancer survivors in East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia had an adequate intake of most nutrients except for dietary fibre, monounsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, calcium, iron and potassium which was below the recommendation and sodium, protein, saturated fatty acids, vitamin B2, vitamin C which was above the recommendation. The intakes between long-term and short-term survivors were also comparable showing sustained dietary intake throughout survivorship. © 2017 Malaysian Journal of Public Health Medicine.},

abstract={Background and Objective: Proteomics has been developed remarkably and become an intensive field of research; especially protein glycosylation which is considered one of the most common post-translational modifications. Glycosylated proteins play vital roles in several biological and molecular pathways and it represents over 50% of human proteins. The aim of this study was to examine differentially expressed glycoprotein profiles of breast cancer and its adjacent tissues among breast cancer women in Malaysia. Materials and Methods: A total of 48 pairs of normal and cancerous tissues were collected from breast cancer women at two hospitals in Penang, Malaysia: Seberang Jaya Hospital (SJH) and Kepala Batas Hospital (KBH) from January 2010- January 2013. Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was employed to map protein expression profiles. Gel-Eluted Liquid Fractionation Entrapment Electrophoresis (GELFREE) system was used for separation and fractionation of protein extracts. The protein extracts were subjected to molecular weight fractionation via electrophoretic separation through SDS PAGE material in tubular environment, all in the liquid phase. The enrichment of GELFREE fractions was carried out using glycopeptide enrichment strategy. After that, they were fragmented by tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis using LC/MS LTQ-Orbitrap Fusion. The protein profiling was done using PEAKS Client (7.5) software. Results: In this study, 11 glycoproteins were detected only in tumour tissues, but not in normal ones. Extracted protein concentrations, number of proteins and glycopeptides were found to be higher in tumour tissue samples compared to normal tissue samples. Conclusion: The findings of this study provided useful insights into the glycoproteins identification and could establish fundamental insights for further differential glycoproteomics profiling for breast cancer biomarker discovery. © 2017 Abdullah Saleh Al-wajeeh et al.},

abstract={Background: Breast cancer is the commonest cancer among women worldwide. About one in nineteen women in Malaysia are at risk, compared to one in eight in Europe and the United States. The objectives of this study were: (1) to assess patients' knowledge on risk factors, symptoms and methods of screening of breast cancer; and (2) to determine their perceptions towards the disease treatment outcomes. Methods: A cross-sectional survey using a validated selfadministered questionnaire was conducted among 119 consecutive surgical female patients admitted from 1st of September to 8th of October 2015 in Hospital Sultan Abdul Halim, Kedah. Data were analyzed using General linear regression and Spearman's correlation with Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 20. Results: Mean (SD) age was 40.6 (15.1) years and majority of the patients were Malay (106, 89.1%). Mean scores for general knowledge, risk factors and symptoms of breast cancer were 50.2 (24.0%), 43.0 (22.9%) and 64.4 (28.4%) respectively. Mean total knowledge score was 52.1(19.7%). 80 (67.2%) and 55 (46.2%) patients were aware of breast self-examination and clinical breast examination recommendations, respectively. Generally, patients had positive perceptions towards breast cancer treatment outcomes. However, majority (59.7%) considered that it would be a long and painful process. Knowledge was significantly better among married women with spouses (p=0.046), those with personal history of breast cancer (p=0.022) and with monthly personal income (p=0.001) with the coefficient of determination, R2=0.16. Spearman's correlation test showed a significant positive relationship between monthly personal income and breast cancer awareness (r = 0.343, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Awareness on breast cancer among our patients was average. Thus, there is a need for more awareness programs to educate women about breast cancer and promote its early detection.},

abstract={We aim to identify clinicopathologic predictors for response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and to evaluate the prognostic value of pathologic complete response (pCR) on survival in Asia. This study included 915 breast cancer patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy at five public hospitals in Singapore and Malaysia. pCR following neoadjuvant chemotherapy was defined as 1) no residual invasive tumor cells in the breast (ypT0/is) and 2) no residual invasive tumor cells in the breast and axillary lymph nodes (ypT0/is ypN0). Association between pCR and clinicopathologic characteristics and treatment were evaluated using chi-square test and multivariable logistic regression. Kaplan–Meier analysis and log-rank test, stratified by other prognostic factors, were conducted to compare overall survival between patients who achieved pCR and patients who did not. Overall, 4.4% of nonmetastatic patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The median age of preoperatively treated patients was 50 years. pCR rates were 18.1% (pCR ypT0/is) and 14.4% (pCR ypT0/is ypN0), respectively. pCR rate was the highest among women who had higher grade, smaller size, estrogen receptor negative, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive disease or receiving taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients who achieved pCR had better overall survival than those who did not. In subgroup analysis, the survival advantage was only significant among women with estrogen receptor-negative tumors. Patients with poor prognostic profile are more likely to achieve pCR and particularly when receiving taxane-containing chemotherapy. pCR is a significant prognostic factor for overall survival especially in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancers. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={Purpose: To assess the patterns of use of bisphosphonate therapies for hypercalcaemia in breast cancer patients, and their outcomes. Methods: A retrospective chart review study of breast cancer patients hospitalised between 2009 and 2014 at Penang Hospital, a public tertiary hospital in Malaysia was conducted. Patients with mild (total serum calcium = 10.5 - 11.9 mg/dl); moderate (12 - 12.9 mg/dl), and severe (≥13 mg/dl) hypercalcaemia at cancer diagnosis or during cancer treatment were included. Relevant data were extracted from medical records analyzed statistically. Results: From the records, 1,023 breast cancer patients were identified, 164 of which had hypercalcaemia at cancer diagnosis or during cancer treatment. About 25% of the hypercalcaemic patients had advanced-stage cancer, while 20% had severe hypercalcaemia. Regarding the pattern of bisphosphonate use, the results showed that more than half of the patients received pamidronate as first-line treatment; about a quarter were treated with zoledronic acid, while others received only normal saline. These treatments produced significant reductions in serum calcium levels relative to baseline values. Conclusion: Although zoledronic acid is considered as the treatment of choice for hypercalcemia of malignancy, the current study found that the first line treatment used for hypercalcemia is pamidronate, mainly because its cost is lower than that of zoledronic acid. © Pharmacotherapy Group, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Benin, Benin City, 300001 Nigeria.

abstract={The type of specific learning needs of women with breast cancer using the Information Needs Questionnaire (INQ) had been identified prior to developing a breast cancer education package. It is also important to determine the types of patient factors such as demographic and clinical factors that influence women's specific learning needs on breast cancer. This study thus reports the findings on what type of patient factors influence women's specific learning needs related to the types of INQ. A total of 140 women with breast cancer who sought treatment at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre participated in this cross sectional study. Age showed a significant relationship with specific learning needs on sexual attractiveness (p=0.001) and self-care (p=0.048). Duration of illness was related to information on spread of breast cancer (p=0.040) and self-care (p=0.047). Education level showed a significant relationship with cure (p=0.001), sexual attractiveness (p=0.007) and spread of breast cancer (p=0.003). Occupation showed a significant relationship with specific learning needs on sexual attractiveness (p=0.005), chemotherapy (p=0.043), radiotherapy (p=0.039) and hormonal therapy (p=0.043). On treatment received, a significant relationship was noted with sexual attractiveness (p=0.009), radiotherapy (p=0.029), hormonal therapy (p=0.038) and targeted therapy (p=0.047). Ethnicity and Marital status showed no significant relationship with all the specific learning needs. Findings of this study concluded that certain patient factors had significant relationship with certain specific learning needs. All the patient factors studied and their influence on the specific learning needs were taken into consideration prior to developing the breast cancer education package.},

abstract={Background. Kefir is a unique cultured product that contains beneficial probiotics. Kefir culture from other parts of the world exhibits numerous beneficial qualities such as anti-inflammatory, immunomodulation, and anticancer effects. Nevertheless, kefir cultures from different parts of the world exert different effects because of variation in culture conditions and media. Breast cancer is the leading cancer in women, and metastasis is the major cause of death associated with breast cancer. The antimetastatic and antiangiogenic effects of kefir water made from kefir grains cultured in Malaysia were studied in 4T1 breast cancer cells. Methods. 4T1 cancer cells were treated with kefir water in vitro to assess its antimigration and anti-invasion effects. BALB/c mice were injected with 4T1 cancer cells and treated orally with kefir water for 28 days. Results. Kefir water was cytotoxic toward 4T1 cells at IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) of 12.5 and 8.33 mg/mL for 48 and 72 hours, respectively. A significant reduction in tumor size and weight (0.9132 ± 0.219 g) and a substantial increase in helper T cells (5-fold) and cytotoxic T cells (7-fold) were observed in the kefir water-treated group. Proinflammatory and proangiogenic markers were significantly reduced in the kefir water-treated group. Conclusions. Kefir water inhibited tumor proliferation in vitro and in vivo mainly through cancer cell apoptosis, immunomodulation by stimulating T helper cells and cytotoxic T cells, and anti-inflammatory, antimetastatic, and antiangiogenesis effects. This study brought out the potential of the probiotic beverage kefir water in cancer treatment. © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={Background: Factors associated with surgery, adjuvant radiotherapy, and chemotherapy and whether there were missed opportunities for treatment in elderly patients were determined in an Asian setting. Methods: All 5616 patients, diagnosed with breast cancer in University Malaya Medical Centre from 1999 to 2013 were included. In 945 elderly patients (aged 65 years and above), multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with treatment, following adjustment for age, ethnicity, tumor, and other treatment characteristics. The impact of lack of treatment on survival of the elderly was assessed while accounting for comorbidities. Results: One in five elderly patients had comorbidities. Compared to younger patients, the elderly had more favorable tumor characteristics, and received less loco-regional treatment and chemotherapy. Within stage I–IIIa elderly breast cancer patients, 10 % did not receive any surgery. These patients were older, more likely to be Malays, have comorbidities, and bigger tumors. In elderlies with indications for adjuvant radiotherapy, no irradiation (30 %) was associated with increasing age, comorbidity, and the absence of systemic therapy. Hormone therapy was optimal, but only 35 % of elderly women with ER negative tumors received chemotherapy. Compared to elderly women who received adequate treatment, those not receiving surgery (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.30, 95 %CI: 1.10–4.79), or radiotherapy (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.56, 95 %CI: 1.10–2.19), were associated with higher mortality. Less than 25 % of the survival discrepancy between elderly women receiving loco-regional treatment and no treatment were attributed to excess comorbidities in untreated patients. Conclusion: While the presence of comorbidities significantly influenced loco-regional treatment decisions in the elderly, it was only able to explain the lower survival rates in untreated patients up to a certain extent, suggesting missed opportunities for treatment. © 2016, Société Internationale de Chirurgie.},

abstract={Cancer is a disease of cells and virtually affects everyone as it is one of the most common factors that influenced the deaths of people in Malaysia. Breast cancer patient who were diagnosed, varies among institution in Malaysia. A study was conduct to review the deaths of breast cancer based on the breast cancer data in Malaysia. The breast cancer data contains 62 numbers of observations according to the duration of data collected from years 1980 until 2010. The data was collected yearly in Malaysia by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IMHE) on the systematic analysis of collecting the data. There were three variables which comprised the number of deaths of breast cancer, the number of cases of breast cancer and the age group. The dependent variable was the number of deaths of breast cancer, while the independent variable includes the number of cases of breast cancer and the age group which comprised women aged 15-49 and women aged 50-79. The first objective of the study was to determine the trend pattern of the number of breast cancer deaths among women aged 15-49 and women aged 50-79. The second objective was to identify the best count data model that fit the number of breast cancer deaths among women aged 15-49 and women aged 50-79. The last objective was to identify factors that affecting the deaths of breast cancer from the cases of breast cancer and the women aged 15-49 and women aged 50-79. The breast cancer data was analyzed using the EXCEL, SPSS software and SAS procedure. The finding indicates that: (1) the trend pattern of women aged 15-49 was lower compared to the pattern of women aged 50-79. (2) The best fit model to be used when modelling counts data was the Negative Binomial regression analysis model. (3) The factor that show high influences on analyzing the number of deaths of breast cancer was number of cases. © 2016 Author(s).},

abstract={Background: CancerMath is a set of web-based prognostic tools which predict nodal status and survival up to 15 years after diagnosis of breast cancer. This study validated its performance in a Southeast Asian setting. Methods: Using Singapore Malaysia Hospital-Based Breast Cancer Registry, clinical information was retrieved from 7064 stage I to III breast cancer patients who were diagnosed between 1990 and 2011 and underwent surgery. Predicted and observed probabilities of positive nodes and survival were compared for each subgroup. Calibration was assessed by plotting observed value against predicted value for each decile of the predicted value. Discrimination was evaluated by area under a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) with 95 % confidence interval (CI). Results: The median predicted probability of positive lymph nodes is 40.6 % which was lower than the observed 43.6 % (95 % CI, 42.5 %-44.8 %). The calibration plot showed underestimation for most of the groups. The AUC was 0.71 (95 % CI, 0.70-0.72). Cancermath predicted and observed overall survival probabilities were 87.3 % vs 83.4 % at 5 years after diagnosis and 75.3 % vs 70.4 % at 10 years after diagnosis. The difference was smaller for patients from Singapore, patients diagnosed more recently and patients with favorable tumor characteristics. Calibration plot also illustrated overprediction of survival for patients with poor prognosis. The AUC for 5-year and 10-year overall survival was 0.77 (95 % CI: 0.75-0.79) and 0.74 (95 % CI: 0.71-0.76). Conclusions: The discrimination and calibration of CancerMath were modest. The results suggest that clinical application of CancerMath should be limited to patients with better prognostic profile. © 2016 The Author(s).},

The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between sociodemographic factors with knowledge, attitude, and perception on BC screening among the females of University Kuala Lumpur, Royal College of Medicine Perak (UniKL RCMP). Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from 2015 to 2016. The populations included were the students and staff of UniKL RCMP. The simple sampling method was used and a set of questionnaire was prepared and distributed to the participants who were willing to participate. The data were analyzed by using the SPSS version 17. Results: Of the 220 only 203 questionnaires were returned. Nearly 87.7% of participants indicated genetic factors as the cause of BC, followed by exposure to carcinogenic and X-ray. Excessive smoking (54.2%) and sedentary lifestyle (52.2%) were the risk factors of the BC. 100% of participants thought that breast self-examination (BSE) is important to detect a breast lump and most of them (76.8%) knew what a mammogram is but only 2.0% went for a mammogram. Chemotherapy (71.9%) and surgery (71.9%) were treatments options according to study participants. Nearly 91.1% agreed that regular mammogram could help to detect BC at an early stage. Nearly 88.2% thought BC is not easily curable. Finally, for the attitude on BC screening, most of them knew how to perform BSE (69.0%) with the frequency of 36.0% doing it once a year. Conclusions: The majority of the participants found the good knowledge on BC and on how to perform BSE. Although most of them knew what a mammogram is, only a few have gone for it since perhaps it is recommended for those who are above 50-year-old. Therefore, researchers believe and trust that there is an urgent need of state-funded multicenter study to prevent and early diagnosis of BC in Malaysia. © 2016 Indian Journal of Medical and Paediatric Oncology.},

abstract={Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in Malaysia. Therefore, it is important for the public to be educated on breast cancer and to know the steps that need to be taken to detect it early. Healthcare providers are in a unique position to provide public health education due to their good knowledge of health issues and their roles in healthcare. A systematic review of studies conducted from 2008 till 2015 was undertaken to analyze the knowledge, attitudes and behavior of Malaysian healthcare providers regarding breast cancer, in an attempt to obtain an overall picture of how well-equipped the healthcare providers are to provide optimal breast cancer education, and to ascertain their perceptions and actual involvement in such education. The systematic review was conducted via a primary search of various databases and journal websites, and a secondary search of references cited in eligible studies. Criteria for eligibility include studies conducted in Malaysia and published from the year 2008 to 2015, and written in English language. A total of fifteen articles were identified and reviewed but only two studies were eligible for this review. The findings suggest that future and current Malaysian healthcare providers have moderate knowledge of breast cancer, showed a positive disposition towards involvement in breast cancer education, but displayed poor involvement. © Pharmacotherapy Group, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Benin, Benin City, 300001 Nigeria.

abstract={Ethnopharmacological relevance: Dillenia suffruticosa is traditionally used for treatment of cancerous growth including breast cancer in Malaysia. Aim of the study: Dillenia suffruticosa is a well-known medicinal plant in Malaysia for the treatment of cancer. Nevertheless, no study has been reported the cytotoxicity of this plant towards MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells. The present study was designed to investigate the mode of cell death and signalling pathways of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with dichloromethane Dillenia suffruticosa root extract (DCM-DS). Methods: Extraction of Dillenia suffruticosa root was performed by the use of sequential solvent procedure. The cytotoxicity of DCM-DS was determined by using MTT assay. The mode of cell death was evaluated by using an inverted light microscope and flow cytometry analysis using Annexin-V/PI. Cell cycle analysis and measurement of reactive oxygen species level were performed by using flow cytometry. The cells were treated with DCM-DS and antioxidants α-tocopherol or ascorbic acid to evaluate the involvement of ROS in the cytotoxicity of DCM-DS. Effect of DCM-DS on the expression of antioxidant, apoptotic, growth, survival genes and proteins were analysed by using GeXP-based multiplex system and Western blot, respectively. The cytotoxicity of compounds isolated from DCM-DS was evaluated towards MDA-MB-231 cells using MTT assay. Results: DCM-DS induced apoptosis, G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and oxidative stress in MDA-MB-231 cells. The induction of apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells by DCM-DS is possibly due to the activation of pro-apoptotic JNK1 and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic ERK1, which in turn down-regulates anti-apoptotic BCL-2 to increase the BAX/BCL-2 ratio to initiate the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. The cell cycle arrest in DCM-DS-treated MDA-MB-231 cells is possibly via p53-independent but p21-dependent pathway. A total of 3 triterpene compounds were isolated from DCM-DS. Betulinic acid appears to be the most major and most cytotoxic compound in DCM-DS. Conclusion: The data suggest the potential application of DCM-DS in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background: APOBEC3B is a cytosine deaminase implicated in immune response to viral infection, cancer predisposition and carcinogenesis. Germline APOBEC3B deletion is more common in East Asian women and confers a modest risk to breast cancer in both East Asian and Caucasian women. Analysis of tumour samples from women of European descent has shown that germline APOBEC3B deletion is associated with an increased propensity to develop somatic mutations and with an enrichment for immune response-related gene sets. However, this has not been examined in Asian tumour samples, where population differences in genetic and dietary factors may have an impact on the immune system. Methods: In this study, we determined the prevalence of germline APOBEC3B deletion and its association with breast cancer risk in a cross-sectional hospital-based Asian multi-ethnic cohort of 1451 cases and 1442 controls from Malaysia. We compared gene expression profiles of breast cancers arising from APOBEC3B deletion carriers and non-carriers using microarray analyses. Finally, we characterised the overall abundance of tumour-infiltrating immune cells in breast cancers from TCGA and METABRIC using ESTIMATE and relative frequency of 22 immune cell subsets in breast cancers from METABRIC using CIBERSORT. Results: The minor allelic frequency of APOBEC3B deletion was estimated to be 0.35, 0.42 and 0.16 in female populations of Chinese, Malay and Indian descent, respectively, and that germline APOBEC3B deletion was associated with breast cancer risk with odds ratios of 1.23 (95 % CI: [1.05, 1.44]) for one-copy deletion and 1.38 (95 % CI: [1.10, 1.74]) for two-copy deletion compared to women with no deletion. Germline APOBEC3B deletion was not associated with any clinicopathologic features or the expression of any APOBEC family members but was associated with immune response-related gene sets (FDR q values < 0.05). Analysis of breast cancers from METABRIC revealed breast cancers from APOBEC3B deletion carriers to have significantly higher abundance of tumour-infiltrating immune cells (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Taken together, our data suggests that tumour-infiltrating immune cells may be an important feature of breast cancers arising in women with APOBEC3B germline deletion, and that this may be of particular interest in Asian women where the germline deletion is more common. © 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: Evidence suggests the use of complementary therapies may help in relieving the adverse effects of cancer-related treatment, including nausea. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of inhaled ginger essential oil (EO) in improving dietary intake in women with breast cancer experiencing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). General perception on the use of ginger aromatherapy was also evaluated. Methods: A single-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover study was conducted in two oncology clinics in Peninsular Malaysia. Women received 5 days of aromatherapy treatment using either ginger EO or fragrance-matched placebo [ginger fragrance oil (FO)] in an order dictated by the treatment group sequence. The following aspects were evaluated: nutritional status (BMI, nutritional requirement, dietary intake) and general perception of aromatherapy. Results: Sixty women completed the study (age=47.3±9.26 years; receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy=86.7%; BMI=25.5±5.4 kg/m2). Energy intakes were significantly higher after patients were treated with ginger EO than ginger FO at day 3 (P=0.015) and day 5 (P=0.002). Significant improvements in energy intake were also observed over time [F(2,57)=54.21, P&lt;0.001], reaching almost 90% of the energy requirement 5 days’ post-chemotherapy. Inhaled aromatherapy using ginger EO was rated marginally more helpful than the ginger FO (63.3% vs. 61.6%). Being delivered via a necklace, the treatment method was considered feasible for participating women. Conclusion: The use of inhaled ginger EO for CINV could possibly help patients resume their dietary intake. This complementary treatment was also favourably received by the participating women. © 2016 Royal Pharmaceutical Society},

abstract={Background: Addressing breast cancer patients' unmet supportive care needs in the early stage of their survivorship have become a prime concern because of its significant association with poor quality of life (QOL), which in turn increases healthcare utilization and costs. There is no study about unmet supportive care needs of breast cancer patients in Malaysia. This study aims to assess the most prevalent unmet supportive care needs of Malaysian breast cancer patients and the association between QOL and patients' characteristics, and their unmet supportive care needs. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Surgery and Oncology Clinic between May 2014 and June 2014 in a tertiary hospital in Malaysia. A total of 117 patients out of 133 breast cancer patients recruited by universal sampling were interviewed using a structured questionnaire consisted of three parts: participants' socio-demographic and disease characteristics, Supportive Care Needs Survey-Short Form Questionnaire (SCNS-SF34) and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). Results: The highest unmet supportive care needs were observed in the psychological domain (Mean 53.31; SD ± 21.79), followed by physical domain (Mean 38.16; SD ± 27.15). Most prevalent unmet supportive care needs were uncertainty about the future (78.6 %), fears about the cancer spreading (76.1 %), feelings of sadness (69.2 %), feelings about death and dying (68.4 %), concerns about those close to the patient (65.0 %) and feeling down or depressed (65.0 %). Multivariate linear analysis showed that early breast cancer survivors diagnosed at an advanced stage and with greater physical and psychological needs were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with poorer QOL. Conclusion: Most prevalent unmet needs among Malaysian breast cancer patients were found in the psychological domain. Early breast cancer survivors with late stage diagnosis who had more unmet needs in psychological and physical domains were more likely to have a poor QOL. © 2016 Edib et al.},

abstract={The objective of this case-control study was to determine anthropometric and reproductive factors associated with the development of breast cancer among women. Fifty-six newly diagnosed breast cancer patients were recruited from the Oncology Clinic, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM), and 56 healthy female hospital employees were recruited as controls. Socio-demographic and reproductive data were obtained using a standard questionnaire. Anthropometric factors (body weight, height, body fat percentage, visceral fat and waist and hip circumference) were assessed. A high waist circumference (adjusted OR= 1.04, [95% CI: 1.00, 1.09]) and being more than 30 years of age at first full-term pregnancy (adjusted OR=3.77, [95% CI: 1.10, 12.90]) were predictors of breast cancer development. The results of this study indicate that weight and reproductive health management should be emphasized for breast cancer prevention in Malaysia.},

abstract={Background: GLOBOCAN12 recently reported high cancer mortality in Malaysia suggesting its cancer health services are under-performing. Cancer survival is a key index of the overall effectiveness of health services in the management of patients. This report focuses on Subang Jaya Medical Centre (SJMC) care performance as measured by patient survival outcome for up to 5 years. Materials and Methods: All women with breast cancer treated at SJMC between 2008 and 2012 were enrolled for this observational cohort study. Mortality outcome was ascertained through record linkage with national death register, linkage with hospital registration system and finally through direct contact by phone or home visits. Results: A total of 675 patients treated between 2008 and 2012 were included in the present survival analysis, 65% with early breast cancer, 20% with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) and 4% with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). The overall relative survival (RS) at 5 years was 88%. RS for stage I was 100% and for stage II, III and IV disease was 95%, 69% and 36% respectively. Conclusions: SJMC is among the first hospitals in Malaysia to embark on routine measurement of the performance of its cancer care services and its results are comparable to any leading centers in developed countries.},

abstract={Background: Physical inactivity has been identified as the fourth leading risk factor for global mortality and is associated with increased breast cancer diagnosis and recurrence. Purpose: To examine the association between adult lifetime physical activity and breast cancer risk in a case-control analysis. Materials and Methods: This study involved 122 cases of breast cancer and 121 controls in the state of Kelantan in Malaysia. A comprehensive measure of lifetime physical activity was used to assess occupational, household, and recreational/sports activity. For every type of activity, a metabolic equivalent (MET) score was assigned using the compendium of physical activities. MET-hours/week per year for all types of activities at different levels of intensities for different age groups were calculated. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios between various measures of physical activity and breast cancer risk. Conclusions: The mean MET-hours/week per year for all activities were 120.0 and 132.9 of MET-hours/week per year for cases and controls respectively. Household activities accounted about 70% of the total lifetime physical activities. Only about 2.5% of the total lifetime physical activities were in the form of recreational/sports. This study found no association between lifetime occupational and recreational/sports physical activities with breast cancer risk among the Kelantanese women. However, higher intensity lifetime household activities seemed to significantly reduce risk of breast cancer.},

abstract={Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease that can be classified using a variety of clinical and pathological features. In Malaysia, breast cancer remains the most prevalence malignancy among women which vary substantially by racial/ ethnic group. A pilot study was conducted to determine clinical characteristics of breast cancer (BrCa) and the association with demographic factors from a set of data retrieved from Advanced Medical and Dental Institute (AMDI), Universiti Sains Malaysia (n = 236). In this study, 55.1% of the patients were Malay followed by Chinese (33.9%) and Indian (11.0%). By using Pearson Chi-Square test, it was reported that ethnicity was significantly associated with age at diagnosis (p = 0.001) and family history (p = 0.034). In addition, interrelationships (p value < 0.05) existed between: (1) ethnics with age at diagnosis (2) ER with PR, TNM staging and grading (3) PR with tumor grading. In summary, interrelationships status of BrCa clinicopathological features can be used to better understand BrCa in predicting prognosis for the patients. © 2016 Penerbit UTM Press.

abstract={Approximately 5%-10% of breast cancers are due to genetic predisposition caused by germline mutations; the most commonly tested genes are BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. Some mutations are unique to one family and others are recurrent; the spectrum of BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations varies depending on the geographical origins, populations or ethnic groups. In this review, we compiled data from 11 participating Asian countries (Bangladesh, Mainland China, Hong Kong SAR, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam), and from ethnic Asians residing in Canada and the USA. We have additionally conducted a literature review to include other Asian countries mainly in Central and Western Asia. We present the current pathogenic mutation spectrum of BRCA1/BRCA2 genes in patients with breast cancer in various Asian populations. Understanding BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations in Asians will help provide better risk assessment and clinical management of breast cancer.},

abstract={Background: Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer affecting Malaysian women. Recent statistics revealed that the cumulative probability of breast cancer and related deaths in Malaysia is higher than in most of the countries of Southeast Asia. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CYP2E1 (rs6413432 and rs3813867), STK15 (rs2273535 and rs1047972) and XRCC1 (rs1799782 and rs25487) have been associated with breast cancer risk in a meta-analysis but any link in Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, remained to be determined. Hence, we investigated the relationship between these SNPs and breast cancer risk among Malaysian women in the present case-control study. Materials and Methods: Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood of 71 breast cancer patients and 260 healthy controls and subjected to polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. Results: Our study showed that the c1/c2 genotype or subjects with at least one c2 allele in CYP2E1 rs3813867 SNP had significantly increased almost 1.8-fold higher breast cancer risk in Malaysian women overall. In addition, the variant Phe allele in STK15 rs2273535 SNP appeared to protect against breast cancer in Malaysian Chinese. No significance association was found between XRCC1 SNPs and breast cancer risk in the population. Conclusions: This study provides additional knowledge on CYP2E1, STK15 and XRCC1 SNP impact of risk of breast cancer, particularly in the Malaysian population. From our findings, we also recommend Malaysian women to perform breast cancer screening before 50 years of age.},

abstract={Background: Participation in physical activity has a positive impact on the overall health and quality of life, whereas physical inactivity is associated with a poor prognosis among breast cancer survivors. Despite the health-enhancing benefits of physical activity, the majority of Malaysian breast cancer survivors are not physically active. This paper presents the design of a randomised study to evaluate the feasibility and effect of exercise therapy intervention using light resistance dumbbell exercise to promote active lifestyle and improve the quality of life of breast cancer survivors in Malaysia. Methods/design: This is an intervention study of a 12-week exercise therapy that will explore and compare the effects of light resistance and aerobic exercise on physical activity level and quality of life components in 102 female breast cancer survivors. Major eligibility criteria include histologically confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer stages I–III, 3–12 months post-diagnosis, and absence of any disorder contraindicating exercise. Participants will be stratified based on menopausal status (pre-menopause vs post-menopause) and then assigned randomly to one of three groups. Participants in group A will participate in a three-times weekly supervised resistance exercise using light resistance dumbbells; participants in group B will participate in a three-times weekly supervised aerobic exercise; while participants in group C (control group) will be given aerobic exercise after completion of the intervention. The primary end points include physical activity level and quality of life components. The secondary end points are body mass index, body composition, total caloric intake, and waist-to-hip ratio. Discussion: Although there have been many studies of resistance exercise in breast cancer survivors, this is the first study using this specific mode of resistance. Findings will contribute data on the feasibility and effects of light resistance dumbbell exercises, and provide knowledge on the physical activity intervention programme that will maximally promote better overall health and well-being of survivors. © 2016 BMJ Global Health.

abstract={Social network communities that provide information about cancer offer environments in which cancer patients can interact, and access information related to the disease, its treatment and its survivorship. Current research into the assessment of cancer patients‟ performance in the use of Social Network Sites (SNS) continues to be limited, despite SNS potential to serve as a platform for providing cancer information. To investigate the factors that influence the performance of cancer patients in using SNS, this study utilizes the use of a Task Person Technology Fit (TPTF) Model. Questionnaires were distributed to 178 respondents in two hospitals and four cancer support groups in Peninsular Malaysia, using purposive sampling. Data was analysed through the use of Smart PLS 2.0 M3. The results indicated that the performance of cancer patients in using SNS has been determined directly by the fit between self-efficacy and the characteristics of task and technology. © 2016 Penerbit UTM Press.

abstract={The needs for non-invasive technique in breast cancer detection could enhance and preserve the future of medical field in Malaysia as well as countries around the world. Breast cancer has become the main concern nowadays not only for women but for man as well. In overall, the risk of women getting breast cancer is higher than man due to the denser tissue of breast in women compare to man. Beside the unawareness for the disease, the reason which contributes to this increasing number of breast cancer reported is also due to the limitations arising from modalities such as MRI, Mammography, ultrasound and other modalities. An alternative to current technologies should be improved for early detection and treatment which causes no physical harm to patients if possible. Thus, non-invasive and better technology in detecting breast cancer is very much needed in the current market. This paper will be discussing the insights of Magnetic Induction Tomography techniques in breast cancer detection. © 2016 Penerbit UTM Press. All rights reserved.},

Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the quality of life (QOL) scores among breast cancer patients at a Malaysian public hospital. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study of breast cancer patients was conducted between March to June 2013. QOL scores were determined using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and its breast cancer supplementary measure (QLQ-BR23). Both the QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 assess items from functional and symptom scales. The QLQ-C30 in addition also measures the Global Health Status (GHS). Systematic random sampling was used to recruit patients. Results: 223 breast cancer patients were recruited with a response rate of 92.1%. The mean age of the patients was 52.4 years (95% CI = 51.0, 53.7, SD=10.3). Majority of respondents are Malays (60.5%), followed by Chinese (19.3%), Indians (18.4%), and others (1.8%). More than 50% of respondents are at stage III and stage IV of malignancy. The mean Global Health Status was 65.7 (SD = 21.4). From the QLQ-C30, the mean score in the functioning scale was highest for 'cognitive functioning' (84.1, SD=18.0), while the mean score in the symptom scale was highest for 'financial difficulties' (40.1, SD=31.6). From the QLQ-BR23, the mean score for functioning scale was highest for 'body image' (80.0, SD=24.6) while the mean score in the symptom scale was highest for 'upset by hair loss' (36.2, SD=29.4). Two significant predictors for Global Health Status were age and employment. The predictors explained 10.6% of the variation of global health status (R2=0.106). Conclusions: Age and employment were found to be significant predictors for Global Health Status (GHS). The Quality of Life among breast cancer patients reflected by the GHS improves as age and employment increases.},

abstract={The cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily D, polypeptide 6 (CYP2D6) is an enzyme that is predominantly involved in the metabolism of tamoxifen. Genetic polymorphisms of the CYP2D6 gene may contribute to inter-individual variability in tamoxifen metabolism, which leads to the differences in clinical response to tamoxifen among breast cancer patients. In Malaysia, the knowledge on CYP2D6 genetic polymorphisms as well as metabolizer status in Malaysian breast cancer patients remains unknown. Hence, this study aimed to comprehensively identify CYP2D6 genetic polymorphisms among 80 Malaysian breast cancer patients. The genetic polymorphisms of all the 9 exons of CYP2D6 gene were identified using high-resolution melting analysis and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Seven CYP2D6 alleles consisting of CYP2D6 1, CYP2D6 2, CYP2D6 4, CYP2D6 10, CYP2D6 39, CYP2D6 49, and CYP2D6 75 were identified in this study. Among these alleles, CYP2D6 10 is the most common allele in both Malaysian Malay (54.8%) and Chinese (71.4%) breast cancer patients, whereas CYP2D6 4 in Malaysian Indian (28.6%) breast cancer patients. In relation to CYP2D6 genotype, CYP2D6 10/10 is more frequently observed in both Malaysian Malay (28.9%) and Chinese (57.1%) breast cancer patients, whereas CYP2D64/10 is more frequently observed in Malaysian Indian (42.8%) breast cancer patients. In terms of CYP2D6 phenotype, 61.5% of Malaysian Malay breast cancer patients are predicted as extensive metabolizers in which they are most likely to respond well to tamoxifen therapy. However, 57.1% of Chinese as well as Indian breast cancer patients are predicted as intermediate metabolizers and they are less likely to gain optimal benefit from the tamoxifen therapy. This is the first report of CYP2D6 genetic polymorphisms and phenotypes in Malaysian breast cancer patients for different ethnicities. These data may aid clinicians in selecting an optimal drug therapy for Malaysian breast cancer patients, hence improve the clinical outcome of the patients. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Despite continuous argument about the efficacy of breast self-examination; it still could be a life-saving technique through inspiring and empowering women to take better control over their body/breast and health. This study investigated Malaysian female university students' knowledge about breast cancer risk factors, signs, and symptoms and assessed breast self-examination frequency among students.
METHOD: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2013 in nine public and private universities in the Klang Valley and Selangor. 842 female students were respondents for the self-administered survey technique. Simple descriptive and inferential statistics were employed for data analysis.
RESULTS: The uptake of breast self-examination (BSE) was less than 50% among the students. Most of students had insufficient knowledge on several breast cancer risk factors.
CONCLUSION: Actions and efforts should be done to increase knowledge of breast cancer through the development of ethnically and traditionally sensitive educational training on BSE and breast cancer literacy.},

abstract={Vitamin A, C and E intake has been shown to play a role in the etiology of breast cancer, but the findings have been inconsistent and limited to developed countries with higher cancer incidence. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the association of premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer risk with vitamin A, C and E intake from dietary sources. This is a population based case-control study conducted in Malaysian population among 382 breast cancer patients and 382 control group. Dietary intake was assessed via an interviewer-administered food frequency questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to compute odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and a broad range of potential confounders were included in analysis. The results of this study shows a significant decreased risk of breast cancer among premenopausal (ORQ4 to Q1=0.38, 95% CI, 0.12 - 0.55, p-trend=0.001) and postmenopausal (ORQ4 to Q1=0.26, 95% CI, 0.03 - 0.75, p-trend=0.017) women was observed in the highest quartile of beta-carotene intake. Meanwhile, a higher intake of vitamin C showed significantly lowered risk only for premenopausal women (ORQ4 to Q1=0.13, 95% CI, 0.03 - 0.32, p-trend=0.001). As a conclusion, beta-carotene intake was independently related to pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer risk, while vitamin C intake was associated with decreased risk among premenopausal women only. However, no association was observed for vitamin A especially retinol and vitamin E intake from dietary sources.},

abstract={The risk factors of breast cancer among women, such as genetic, family history and lifestyle factors, can be divided into high-, intermediate- and average-risk. Determining these risk factors may actually help in preventing breast cancer occurrence. Besides that, screening of breast cancer which include mammography, can be done in promoting early breast cancer detection. Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been recommended as a supplemental screening tool in high risk women. The aim of this study was to identify the significant risk factor of breast cancer among women and also to determine the usefulness of breast MRI as an addition to mammography in detection of breast cancer in high risk women. This retrospective cohort study design was conducted using patients’ data taken from those who underwent mammography for screening or diagnostic purposes in Advanced Medical and Dental Institute, Universiti Sains Malaysia, from 2007 until 2015. Data from 289 subjects were successfully retrieved and analysed based on their risk factors of breast cancer. Meanwhile, data from 120 subjects who had high risks and underwent both mammography and breast MRI were further analysed. There were two significant risk factors of breast cancer seen among the study population: family history of breast cancer (p-value=0.012) and previous history of breast or ovarian cancer (p-value <0.001). Breast MRI demonstrated high sensitivity (90%) while mammography demonstrated high specificity (80%) in detection of breast cancer in all 120 subjects. The number of cases of breast cancer detection using breast MRI [46 (38.3%)] was higher compared to mammography [24 (20.0%)]. However, breast MRI was found to be non-significant as an adjunct tool to mammography in detecting breast cancer in high risk women (p-value=0.189). A comprehensive screening guideline and surveillance of women at high risk is indeed useful and should be implemented to increase cancer detection rate at early stage. © 2016 Penerbit UTM Press.

abstract={Background: Depression and anxiety are common psychiatric morbidity among breast cancer patient. There is a lack of study examining the correlation between depression, anxiety and quality of life (QoL) with perceived social support (PSS) among breast cancer patients. This study aims to study the level of depression, anxiety, QoL and PSS among Malaysian breast cancer women over a period of 12 months and their associations at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Methods: It is a 12 months prospective cohort study. Two hundred and twenty one female patients were included in the study. They were assessed at the time of diagnosis, 6 months and 12 month using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30), Version 3.0 of the EORTC Study Group and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). The information of age, ethnicity, types of treatment, and staging of cancer were collected. Results: The HADS anxiety and depression subscales scores of the subjects were relatively low. The level of anxiety reduced significantly at 6 and 12 months (Baseline - 6 months, p = 0.002; Baseline - 12 months, p < 0.001). There were no changes in the level of depression over the study period. The global status of QoL and MSPSS scores were relatively high. Correlation between the global status of QoL and MSPSS for the study subjects was positive (Spearman's rho = 0.31-0.36). Global status of QoL and MSPSS scores were negatively correlated with anxiety and depression. Conclusion: Malaysian breast cancer women had relatively better QoL with lower level of anxiety and depression. Perceived social support was an important factor for better QoL and low level of psychological distress. It reflects the importance of attention on activities that enhance and maintain the social support system for breast cancer patients. © 2015 Ng et al.},

abstract={Purpose: The aim of this study is to evaluate the perspectives of Asian oncology practitioners on the physical and psychosocial issues experienced by breast cancer survivors (BCS), current survivorship care practices, and the barriers to follow-up care. Methods: This was a cross-sectional survey study. Oncology practitioners were recruited from a major cancer center in Singapore and through two regional cancer meetings that took place in Singapore and Malaysia in 2013. Results: A total of 126 oncology practitioners from various Southeast Asian countries, mostly nurses (58.7 %) and physicians (37.3 %), were recruited. The majority of the respondents agreed that fatigue (78.4 %) and anxiety (69.1 %) were the most common physical and psychosocial problems experienced by BCS. Monitoring for physical and treatment-related adverse effects (80.7 %) and reviewing patients’ noncancer medical history (65.3 %) were the most practiced aspects of follow-up care. Compared with the other practitioners, the physicians were more likely to communicate with other healthcare professionals (adjusted OR = 4.24, 95 % CI 1.54 to 11.72; p = 0.005). Most of the respondents also agreed that patient-specific barriers were the main impediments to follow-up care. Conclusion: This study provides insights into the various aspects of breast cancer survivorship care from the perspectives of oncology practitioners and shows that survivorship care is relatively inadequate in Asia. There is a need for new survivorship care models to meet the needs of Asian BCS and to complement the unique healthcare systems of Asia. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Up to 25% of breast cancer patients in Asia present with de novo metastatic disease. We examined the survival trends of Asian patients with metastatic breast cancer over fifteen years. The impact of changes in patient's demography, tumor characteristics, tumor burden, and treatment on survival trend were examined. Patients with de novo metastatic breast cancer from three hospitals in Malaysia and Singapore (N = 856) were grouped by year of diagnosis: 1996-2000, 2001-2005 and 2006-2010. Step-wise multivariable Poisson regression was used to estimate the contribution of above-mentioned factors on the survival trend. Proportions of patients presenting with metastatic breast cancer were 10% in 1996-2000, 7% in 2001-2005, and 9% in 2006-2010. Patients in 2006-2010 were significantly older, appeared to have higher disease burden, and received more chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and surgery of primary tumor. The three-year relative survival in the above periods were 20.6% (95% CI: 13.9%-28.2%), 28.8% (95% CI: 23.4%-34.2%), and 33.6% (95% CI: 28.8%-38.5%), respectively. Adjustment for treatment considerably attenuated the relative excess risk of mortality in recent years, compared to other factors. Substantial improvements in survival were observed in patients with de novo metastatic breast cancer in this study.},

abstract={Background: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use has become increasingly popular among patients with cancer. The purposes of this study were to compare the QOL in CAM users and non-CAM users and to determine whether CAM use influences QOL among breast cancer patients during chemotherapy. Methodology: A cross-sectional survey was conducted at two outpatient chemotherapy centers. A total of 546 patients completed the questionnaires on CAM use. QOL was evaluated based on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) core quality of life (QLQ-C30) and breast cancer-specific quality of life (QLQ-BR23) questionnaires. Results: A total of 70.7% of patients were identified as CAM users. There was no significant difference in global health status scores and in all five subscales of the QLQ C30 functional scales between CAM users and non-CAM users. On the QLQ-C30 symptom scales, CAM users (44.96±3.89) had significantly (p = 0.01) higher mean scores for financial difficulties than non-CAM users (36.29±4.81). On the QLQ-BR23 functional scales, CAM users reported significantly higher mean scores for sexual enjoyment (6.01 ±12.84 vs. 4.64±12.76, p = 0.04) than non-CAM users. On the QLQ-BR23 symptom scales, CAM users reported higher systemic therapy side effects (41.34±2.01 vs. 37.22±2.48, p = 0.04) and breast symptoms (15.76±2.13 vs. 11.08±2.62, p = 0.02) than non-CAM users. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the use of CAM modality was not significantly associated with higher global health status scores (p = 0.71). Conclusion: While the findings indicated that there was no significant difference between users and nonusers of CAM in terms of QOL, CAM may be used by health professionals as a surrogate to monitor patients with higher systemic therapy side effects and breast symptoms. Furthermore, given that CAM users reported higher financial burdens (which may have contributed to increased distress), patients should be encouraged to discuss the potential benefits and/or disadvantages of using CAM with their healthcare providers. © 2015 Chui et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.},

We follow closely the work outlined by Unnikrishnan (2010) and present every step of the detection procedure in details. Due to the complexity of the resulting joint posterior distribution, we obtain the information on the posterior distribution from samples generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, in particular, using either the Gibbs sampler or the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. We use local breast cancer patients' data to illustrate the implementation of the method.},

abstract={Introduction: Breast cancer can be divided into four subtypes based on the expressions of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor-2 (HER2). Each subtype has different clinicopathological features and outcomes. Objective: To compare the clinicopathological features and survival of ER and/or PR positive HER2 negative (ER+PR+HER2-, ER+PR-HER2- or ER-PR+HER2-), ER and/or PR positive HER2 positive (ER+PR+HER2+, ER+PR-HER2+ or ER-PR+HER2+), ER negative PR negative HER2 positive (ER-PR-HER2+), and ER negative PR negative HER2 negative (ER-PR-HER2-) subtypes. Methods: 1957 patients with Stage 1-3 breast carcinoma diagnosed between Jan 2005 and Dec 2011 were categorized into the four subtypes. The clinicopathological features between the subtypes were compared using χ2 test. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to estimate 5-year overall survival. Multivariate Cox regression was used to determine the association between subtypes and mortality adjusted for age, ethnicity, stage, pathological features, and treatment. Results: ER-PR-HER2+ and ER-PR-HER2- subtypes were associated with younger age, larger tumors, and higher grade. There was no difference in the 5-year survival of the ER-PR-HER2+ and ER-PR-HER2- subtypes (75.1 and 74.4 %, respectively) and survival was poorer than in the ER and/or PR positive HER2 negative and ER and/or PR positive HER2 positive subtypes (87.1 and 83.1 %, respectively). Only 9.5 % of women with HER2 positive breast cancer had access to trastuzumab. Conclusion: In a low resource setting with limited access to trastuzumab, there is no difference in survival between the ER-PR-HER2+ and ER-PR-HER2- subtypes of breast cancer. © 2015 Société Internationale de Chirurgie.},

abstract={Objective: To assess the efficacy of inhaled ginger aromatherapy on nausea, vomiting and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in chemotherapy breast cancer patients. Design: Single-blind, controlled, randomized cross-over study. Patients received 5-day aromatherapy treatment using either ginger essential oil or fragrance-matched artificial placebo (ginger fragrance oil) which was instilled in a necklace in an order dictated by the treatment group sequence. Setting: Two oncology clinics in the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia. Main outcome measures: VAS nausea score, frequency of vomiting and HRQoL profile (EORTC QLQ-C30 scores). Results: Sixty female patients completed the study (age = 47.3 ± 9.26 years; Malay = 98.3%; on highly emetogenic chemotherapy = 86.7%). The VAS nausea score was significantly lower after ginger essential oil inhalation compared to placebo during acute phase (p = 0.040) but not sustained for overall treatment effect (treatment effect: F = 1.82, p = 0.183; time effect: F = 43.98, P < 0.001; treatment × time effect: F = 2.04; p = 0.102). Similarly, there was no significant effect of aromatherapy on vomiting [F(1, 58) = 0.29, p = 0.594]. However, a statistically significant change from baseline for global health status (P < 0.001) was detected after ginger essential oil inhalation. A clinically relevant 10 points improvement on role functioning (p = 0.002) and appetite loss (P < 0.001) were also documented while patients were on ginger essential oil. Conclusion: At present time, the evidence derived from this study is not sufficiently convincing that inhaled ginger aromatherapy is an effective complementary therapy for CINV. The findings for HRQoL were however encouraging with significant improvement in several domains. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Genome-wide association studies have discovered multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the risk of common diseases. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the replication of previously published SNPs that showed statistical significance for breast cancer in the Malaysian population. In this case–control study, 80 subjects for each group were recruited from various hospitals in Malaysia. A total of 768 SNPs were genotyped and analyzed to distinguish risk and protective alleles. A total of three SNPs were found to be associated with increased risk of breast cancer while six SNPs showed protective effect. All nine were statistically significant SNPs (p ≤ 0.01), five SNPs from previous studies were successfully replicated in our study. Significant modifiable (diet) and non-modifiable (family history of breast cancer in first degree relative) risk factors were also observed. We identified nine SNPs from this study to be either conferring susceptibility or protection to breast cancer which may serve as potential markers in risk prediction. © 2014, Association of Clinical Biochemists of India.},

abstract={CHEK2 is a protein kinase that is involved in cell-cycle checkpoint control after DNA damage. Germline mutations in CHEK2 gene have been associated with increase in breast cancer risk. The aim of this study is to identify the CHEK2 gene germline mutations among high-risk breast cancer patients and its contribution to the multiethnic population in Malaysia. We screened the entire coding region of CHEK2 gene on 59 high-risk breast cancer patients who tested negative for BRCA1/2 germline mutations from UKM Medical Centre (UKMMC), Hospital Kuala Lumpur (HKL) and Hospital Putrajaya (HPJ). Sequence variants identified were screened further in case-control cohorts consisting of 878 unselected invasive breast cancer patients (180 Malays, 526 Chinese and 172 Indian) and 270 healthy individuals (90 Malays, 90 Chinese and 90 Indian). By screening the entire coding region of the CHEK2 gene, two missense mutations, c.480A>G (p.I160M) and c.538C>T (p.R180C) were identified in two unrelated patients (3.4%). Further screening of these missense mutations on the case-control cohorts unveiled the variant p.I160M in 2/172 (1.1%) Indian cases and 1/90 (1.1%) Indian control, variant p.R180C in 2/526 (0.38%) Chinese cases and 0/90 Chinese control, and in 2/180 (1.1%) of Malay cases and 1/90 (1.1%) of Malay control. The results of this study suggest that CHEK2 mutations are rare among high-risk breast cancer patients and may play a minor contributing role in breast carcinogenesis among Malaysian population. © 2015 Mohamad et al.},

abstract={Hormone receptor (HR) negative breast cancers are relatively more common in low-risk than high-risk countries and/or populations. However, the absolute variations between these different populations are not well established given the limited number of cancer registries with incidence rate data by breast cancer subtype. We, therefore, used two unique population-based resources with molecular data to compare incidence rates for the ‘intrinsic’ breast cancer subtypes between a low-risk Asian population in Malaysia and high-risk non-Hispanic white population in the National Cancer Institute’s surveillance, epidemiology, and end results 18 registries database (SEER 18). The intrinsic breast cancer subtypes were recapitulated with the joint expression of the HRs (estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2). Invasive breast cancer incidence rates overall were fivefold greater in SEER 18 than in Malaysia. The majority of breast cancers were HR-positive in SEER 18 and HR-negative in Malaysia. Notwithstanding the greater relative distribution for HR-negative cancers in Malaysia, there was a greater absolute risk for all subtypes in SEER 18; incidence rates were nearly 7-fold higher for HR-positive and 2-fold higher for HR-negative cancers in SEER 18. Despite the well-established relative breast cancer differences between low-risk and high-risk countries and/or populations, there was a greater absolute risk for HR-positive and HR-negative subtypes in the US than Malaysia. Additional analytical studies are sorely needed to determine the factors responsible for the elevated risk of all subtypes of breast cancer in high-risk countries like the United States. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).},

abstract={Objective: To explore and compare barriers to early presentation of self-discovered breast cancer in Singapore and Malaysia. Design: A qualitative interview study with thematic analysis of transcripts. Participants: 67 patients with self-discovered breast symptoms were included in the analysis. Of these, 36% were of Malay ethnicity, 39% were Chinese and 25% Indian, with an average age of 58 years (range 24-82 years). The number of women diagnosed at early stages of cancer almost equalled those at advanced stages. Approximately three-quarters presented with a painless lump, one-quarter experienced a painful lump and 10% had atypical symptoms. Setting: University hospital setting in Singapore and Malaysia. Results: Patients revealed barriers to early presentation not previously reported: the poor quality of online website information about breast symptoms, financial issues and the negative influence of relatives in both countries, while perceived poor quality of care and services in state-run hospitals and misdiagnosis by healthcare professionals were reported in Malaysia. The pattern of presentation by ethnicity remained unchanged where more Malay delayed help-seeking and had more advanced cancer compared to Chinese and Indian patients. Conclusions: There are few differences in the pattern of presentation and in the reported barriers to seek medical care after symptom discovery between Singapore and Malaysia despite their differing economic status. Strategies to reduce delayed presentation are: a need to improve knowledge of disease, symptoms and causes, quality of care and services, and quality of online information; and addressing fear of diagnosis, treatment and hospitalisation, with more effort focused on the Malay ethnic group. Training is needed to avoid missed diagnoses and other factors contributing to delay among health professionals.},

abstract={Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in Malaysia. Therefore, it is highly important for the public to be educated on breast cancer and to know the steps to detect it early on. Healthcare providers are in the prime position to provide such education to the public due to their high knowledge regarding health and their roles in healthcare. The present systematic review involved studies conducted in recent years to analyze the knowledge, attitudes and behavior of Malaysian healthcare providers regarding breast cancer, in attempts to obtain an overall picture of how well equipped our healthcare providers are to provide optimal breast cancer education, and to see their perceptions and actual involvement in said education. The systematic review was conducted via a primary search of various databases and journal websites, and a secondary search of references used by eligible studies. Criteria for eligibility included being published from the year 2008 till present, being conducted in Malaysia, and being written in the English language. A total of two studies were eligible for this review. Findings show that Malaysian future and current healthcare providers have moderate knowledge on breast cancer, have a positive towards involvement of breast cancer education, but have poor actual involvement.},

abstract={Background: Breast cancer is a common cancer affecting women in Malaysia and the use of complementary/alternative medicine (CAM) has been associated with delays in getting treatment. The aim of the study was to explore the use of CAM and the influencing factors in the Northern region of Peninsular Malaysia. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional descriptive study on a convenience sample of 100 Malaysian breast cancer survivors. Findings: The reported use of CAM among the breast cancer survivors was lower than in other studies but the types of CAM used had a similar pattern with nutrition supplements/vitamins being the most common. The factors that positively influenced the use of complimentary/traditional therapy were income and getting information from television or radio. Survivors with access to internet/blogs appear to have lower odds of using complimentary/traditional therapy compared to the respondents who reported no such access. Conclusions: Information transmitted via television and radio appears to have a positive influence on CAM use by breast cancer patients compared to other information sources and it is important to ensure that such information is accurate and impartial.},

abstract={Background: Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second principal cause of cancer deaths among women worldwide, including Malaysia. This study focused on media choice and attempted to determine the communication channels mostly used and preferred by women in seeking information and knowledge about breast cancer. Materials and Methods: A cross sectional study was carried out to examine the breast cancer prevention information seeking behavior among 450 students at one private university in Malaysia. Results: The mean age of respondents was 25±4.3 years. Common interpersonal information sources were doctors, friends, and nurses and common channel information sources were television, brochure, and internet. Overall, 89.9% used cell phones, 46.1% had an interest in receiving cell phone breast cancer prevention messages, 73.9% used text messaging, and 36.7% had an interest in receiving text breast cancer prevention messages. Bivariate analysis revealed significant differences among age, eduation, nationality and use of cell phones. Conclusions: Assessment of health information seeking behavior is important for community health educators to target populations for program development.},

abstract={Background: In Malaysia, breast cancer is the first cancer among females regardness of race. Aim: The purpose of this study was to identify the knowledge and BSE practice among undergraduate female students at four public universities in Klang Valley, Malaysia. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 820 undergraduate female students using a self-administered questionnaire covering socio-demographic data, knowledge of breast cancer and BSE practice. Results: The mean age of the respondents was 21.7±1.2 years. The majority of them were single (96.8%), Malay (91.9%) and 16.5% of respondents had a family history of breast cancer. This study showed low level of knowledge on breast cancer and breast self-examination among participants. Only 19.6% participants were performing BSE regularly. Knowledge of breast self-examination was significantly associated with BSE practice (p=0.00). Also, there were significant associations between performing BSE with age, marital status and being trained by a doctor for doing BSE (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Our findings showed that the rate of BSE practice and knowledge of breast cancer is inadequate among young Malaysian females. A public health education program is essential to improve breast cancer prevention among this group.},

abstract={Breast cancer remains as a serious health issue in Malaysia and most presentation of breast cancer incidences are at the later stage which will reduce the survival rate. Breast Self-Examination for all women (BSE), Clinical Breast Examination for women above 40 years old (CBE) and Mammography for the older and high-risk groups are the current policies that are available in the government hospitals and selected clinics. However, BSE and CBE could not detect the early stage breast cancer while Mammography is less sensitive in detecting tumor in high dense breast tissue. Both factors have caused an increase in the overall percentage of later stage presentation of breast cancer in Malaysia. In this paper, a feasibility study of breast cancer screening and risk monitoring using Thermography technique is presented. Thermography technique is capable in identifying any physiological changes occur prior to lump formation. This technique is simple, cheaper, and produce no radiation which will allow a safe regular screening. In this study, a series of screenings has been performed on carcinogenic induced rats and thermal images acquired were then analyzed for risk monitoring. Visual analysis shown that the presence of hotspot and asymmetrical temperature profile could be an indicator of a high risk patient while temperature measurement on both induced and control groups shows a significant difference in standard deviation of the surface temperature with smaller deviation of 0.31±0.08 observed in control group while bigger deviation of 2.23±0.78 observed in the induced group. Hence, it is shown that Thermography technique could be a potential modality for upfront breast screening in Malaysia. © 2015 Penerbit UTM Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background: Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer mortality among women of all ethnic and age groups in Malaysia. Delay in seeking help for breast cancer symptoms is preventable and by identifying possible factors for delayed diagnosis, patient prognosis and survival rates could be improved. Objectives: This narrative review aimed to understand and evaluate the level of in-depth breast cancer knowledge in terms of clinical breast examination and breast self-examination, and other important aspects such as side-effects and risk factors in Malaysian females. Since Malaysia is multicultural, this review assessed social perceptions, cultural beliefs and help-seeking behaviour in respect to breast cancer among different ethnic groups, since these may impinge on efforts to 'avoid' the disease. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive literature search of seven databases was performed from December 2015 to January 2015. Screening of relevant published journals was also undertaken to identify available information related to the knowledge, perception and help-seeking behaviour of Malaysian women in relation to breast cancer. Results: A total of 42 articles were appraised and included in this review. Generally, women in Malaysia had good awareness of breast cancer and its screening tools, particularly breast self-examination, but only superficial in-depth knowledge about the disease. Women in rural areas had lower levels of knowledge than those in urban areas. It was also shown that books, magazines, brochures and television were among the most common sources of breast cancer information. Delay in presentation was attributed mainly to a negative social perception of the disease, poverty, cultural and religion practices, and a strong influence of complementary and alternative medicine, rather than a lack of knowledge. Conclusions: This review highlighted the need for an intensive and in-depth breast cancer education campaigns using media and community health programmes, even with the existing good awareness of breast cancer. This is essential in order to avoid misconceptions and to frame the correct mind-set about breast cancer among women in Malaysia. Socio-cultural differences and religious practices should be taken into account by health care professionals when advising on breast cancer. Women need to be aware of the risk factors and symptoms of breast cancer so that early diagnosis can take place and the chances of survival improved.},

abstract={Background: Breast cancer is one of the most feared diseases among women and it could induce the development of psychological disorders like anxiety and depression. An assessment was here performed of the status and to determine contributory factors. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among breast cancer patients at University Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Center (UKMMC), Kuala Lumpur. A total of 205 patients who were diagnosed between 2007 until 2010 were interviewed using the questionnaires of Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HADS). The associated factors investigated concerned socio-demographics, socio economic background and the cancer status. Descriptive analysis, chi-squared tests and logistic regression were used for the statistical test analysis. Results: The prevalence of anxiety was 31.7% (n = 65 ) and of depression was 22.0% (n = 45) among the breast cancer patients. Age group (p = 0.032), monthly income (p = 0.015) and number of visits per month (p = 0.007) were significantly associated with anxiety. For depression, marital status (p = 0.012), accompanying person (p = 0.041), financial support (p-0.007) and felt burden (p = 0.038) were significantly associated. In binary logistic regression, those in the younger age group were low monthly income were 2 times more likely to be associated with anxiety. Having less financial support and being single were 3 and 4 times more likely to be associated with depression. Conclusions: In management of breast cancer patients, more care or support should be given to the young and low socio economic status as they are at high risk of anxiety and depression.},

abstract={Background: Even after completion of conventional treatment, breast cancer survivors continue to exhibit a variety of psychological and physical symptoms, affecting their quality of life. The study aimed to investigate the relationship between socio-demography, medical characteristics and health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) of a sample of breast cancer survivors in Malaysia. Materials and Methods: This pilot cross-sectional survey was conducted among breast cancer survivors (n=40) who were members of Breast Cancer Support Group Centre Johor Bahru. A validated self-administered questionnaire was used to identify the relationships between socio-demography, medical characteristics and HR-QOL of the participants. Results: Living with family and completion of treatment were significant predictive factors of self-rated QOL, while living with family and ever giving birth significantly predicted satisfaction with health and physical health. Psychological health had moderate correlations with number of children and early cancer stage. Survivors' higher personal income (>MYR4,500) was the only significant predictor of social relationship, while age, income more than MYR4,500 and giving birth significantly predicted environment domain score.

abstract={Introduction: In Malaysia, late stage presentation of breast cancer (stage III or IV) has been a healthcare problem that varies geographically throughout the country. This study aims to understand the factors influencing late stage of breast cancer at presentation among Malaysian women in Segamat Hospital, Johor, which is a district hospital. Methods: A retrospective descriptive study was conducted on secondary data of all newly diagnosed breast cancer women from 1st August 2011 to 28th February 2014. Secondary data includes age, ethnicity, marital status, family history, education level, occupation, presenting symptom, duration of symptom, tumour size, tumour pathology, tumour grading, oestrogen, progesterone and HER-2 receptor status were collected and analysed using SPSS version 20.0.0. Result: In total, data from 52 women was analysed and two women were excluded for incompleteness as these women defaulted. Late stage at presentation was 59.6% of all new cases (17.3%, stage III and 42.3%, stage IV). The commonest age group of all women diagnosed with breast cancer was in the 5th decade. Majority of them were Malay, married and housewives with no family history of breast cancer. The statistically significant factors associated with late stage at presentation include Malay ethnicity (p=0.019), presenting symptoms other than breast lump (p=0.047), and duration of breast lump more than 3 months (p=0.009). Discussion/Conclusion: The study demonstrated presentation at late stage of breast cancer is a major health concern among Malaysian women in district hospital. This may be attributed to different sociocultural beliefs, strong belief in complementary and alternative medicine, lack of awareness, and difficult accessibility to healthcare services. © 2015, Malaysian Medical Association.

abstract={Barriers to health seeking constitute a challenging issue in the treatment of breast cancer. The current metasynthesis aimed to explore common barriers to health seeking among Malaysian breast cancer patients. From the systematic search, nine studies were found meeting the inclusion criteria. Data extraction revealed that health behavior towards breast cancer among Malaysia women was influenced by knowledge, psychological, sociocultural and medical system factors. In terms of knowledge, most of the Malaysian patients were observed to have cursory information and the reliance on the information provided by media was limiting. Among psychological factors, stress and sense of denial were some of the common factors leading to delay in treatment seeking. Family member's advice, cultural beliefs towards traditional care were some of the common sociocultural factors hindering immediate access to advanced medical diagnosis and care. Lastly, the delay in referral was one of the most common health system-related problems highlighted in most of the studies. In conclusion, there is an immediate need to improve the knowledge and understanding of Malaysian women towards breast cancer. Mass media should liaise with the cancer specialists to disseminate accurate and up-to-date information for the readers and audience, helping in modification of cultural beliefs that hinder timing health seeking. However, such intervention will not improve or rectify the health system related barriers to treatment seeking. Therefore, there is an immediate need for resource adjustment and training programs among health professional to improve their competency and professionalism required to develop an efficient health system.},

abstract={Breast cancer is the commonest cancer in women worldwide. This study examined the use of spatial analysis and mapping to visualise the disease distribution. The geographic units used were the states of Malaysia. Breast cancer data was obtained from the National Cancer Registry Report 2007 and the female population data was obtained from the Malaysian Census 2010. A spatial analysis was used to analyse the data by indirect standardisation of the underlying female population of each state. Sarawak has a high standardised incidence ratio (SIR) of 16.81 compared to all other states of the country where the highest SIR was only up to 2.15. However, the age-standardised rate (ASR) does not reflect so. SIR could provide a comprehensive evaluation of the disease for further research and public health intervention.},

abstract={Web-based prognostication tools may provide a simple and economically feasible option to aid prognostication and selection of chemotherapy in early breast cancers. We validated PREDICT, a free online breast cancer prognostication and treatment benefit tool, in a resource-limited setting. All 1480 patients who underwent complete surgical treatment for stages I to III breast cancer from 1998 to 2006 were identified from the prospective breast cancer registry of University Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Calibration was evaluated by comparing the model-predicted overall survival (OS) with patients' actual OS. Model discrimination was tested using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Median age at diagnosis was 50 years. The median tumor size at presentation was 3cm and 54% of patients had lymph node-negative disease. About 55% of women had estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Overall, the model-predicted 5 and 10-year OS was 86.3% and 77.5%, respectively, whereas the observed 5 and 10-year OS was 87.6% (difference: -1.3%) and 74.2% (difference: 3.3%), respectively; P values for goodness-of-fit test were 0.18 and 0.12, respectively. The program was accurate in most subgroups of patients, but significantly overestimated survival in patients aged <40 years, and in those receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. PREDICT performed well in terms of discrimination; areas under ROC curve were 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.74-0.81) and 0.73 (95% CI: 0.68-0.78) for 5 and 10-year OS, respectively. Based on its accurate performance in this study, PREDICT may be clinically useful in prognosticating women with breast cancer and personalizing breast cancer treatment in resource-limited settings. © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.},

abstract={Introduction: Over recent decades, the burden of breast cancer has been increasing at an alarming rate in Asia. Prognostic research findings from Western countries may not readily be adapted to Asia, as the outcome of breast cancer depends on a multitude of factors ranging from genetic, clinical and histological predictors, to lifestyle and social predictors. The primary aim of this study is to determine the impact of lifestyle (eg, nutrition, physical activity), mental and sociocultural condition, on the overall survival and quality of life (QoL) among multiethnic Malaysian women following diagnosis of breast cancer. This study aims to advance the evidence on prognostic factors of breast cancer within the Asian setting. The findings may guide management of patients with breast cancer not only during active treatment but also during the survivorship period. Methods: This hospital-based prospective cohort study will comprise patients with breast cancer (18 years and above), managed in the University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC). We aim to recruit 1000 cancer survivors over a 6-year period. Data collection will occur at baseline (within 3 months of diagnosis), 6 months, and 1, 3 and 5 years following diagnosis. The primary outcomes are disease-free survival and overall survival, and secondary outcome is QoL. Factors measured are demographic and socioeconomic factors, lifestyle factors (eg, dietary intake, physical activity), anthropometry measurements (eg, height, weight, waist, hip circumference, body fat analysis), psychosocial aspects, and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) usage. Ethics and dissemination: This protocol was approved by the UMMC Ethical Committee in January 2012. All participants are required to provide written informed consent. The findings from our cohort study will be disseminated via scientific publication as well as presentation to stakeholders including the patients, clinicians, the public and policymakers, via appropriate avenues.},

abstract={Peripheral blood-derived inflammation-based scores such as the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) have recently been proposed as prognostic markers in solid tumours. Although evidence to support these markers as unfavourable prognostic factors is more compelling in gastrointestinal cancers, very little is known of their impact on breast cancer. We investigated the association between the NLR and PLR, and overall survival after breast cancer.Methods:Data from the University of Malaya Medical Centre Breast Cancer Registry was used. Of 2059 consecutive patients diagnosed from 2000 to 2008, we included 1435 patients with an available pre-treatment differential blood count (∼70%). Patients were stratified into quintiles of the NLR/PLR. Multivariable Cox regression was used to determine the independent prognostic significances of the NLR/PLR.Results:Compared with the first quintile of the NLR, women in quintile 5 were younger, had bigger tumours, nodal involvement, distant metastases and higher tumour grades. Higher NLR quintiles were significantly associated with poorer survival with a 5-year relative survival ratio (RSR) of 76.4% (95% CI: 69.6-82.1%) in quintile 1, 79.4% (95% CI: 74.4-83.7%) in quintile 2, 72.1% (95% CI: 66.3-77.3%) in quintile 3, 65.6% (95% CI: 59.8-70.8%) in quintile 4 and 51.1% (95% CI: 43.3-58.5%) in quintile 5. Following adjustment for demography, tumour characteristics, treatment and the PLR, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for quintile 5 vs quintile 1 was 1.50 (95% CI: 1.08-1.63); P trend =0.004. Results were unchanged when the NLR was analysed as a dichotomous variable using different cutoff points. Although patients in PLR quintile 5 had lower survival than in quintile 1 (5-year RSR: 53.2% (95% CI: 46.9-59.2%) vs 77.0% (95% CI: 70.9-82.2%)), this association was not significant after multivariable adjustment. However, a PLR >185 was significantly associated with poorer survival; adjusted HR: 1.25 (95% CI: 1.04-1.52).Conclusions:Both the NLR and PLR are independently associated with an increased risk of mortality in breast cancer. Their added value in the prognostication of breast cancer in clinical practice warrants investigation. © 2015 Cancer Research UK. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Justicia gendarussa methanolic leaf extracts from five different locations in the Southern region of Peninsular Malaysia and two flavonoids, kaempferol and naringenin, were tested for cytotoxic activity. Kaempferol and naringenin were two flavonoids detected in leaf extracts using gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (GC-FID). The results indicated that highest concentrations of kaempferol and naringenin were detected in leaves extracted from Mersing with 1591.80 mg/kg and 444.35 mg/kg, respectively. Positive correlations were observed between kaempferol and naringenin concentrations in all leaf extracts analysed with the Pearson method. The effects of kaempferol and naringenin from leaf extracts were examined on breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) using MTT assay. Leaf extract from Mersing showed high cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 with ICvalues of 23 g/mL and 40 g/mL, respectively, compared to other leaf extracts. Kaempferol possessed high cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 with ICvalues of 23 g/mL and 34 g/mL, respectively. These findings suggest that the presence of kaempferol in Mersing leaf extract contributed to high cytotoxicity of both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cancer cell lines. © 2014 Zahidah Ayob et al.},

The objective of this study was to assess PFH and CAM use among breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed at two chemotherapy providers. Patients were questioned about use of three categories of CAM, mind-body practices (MBPs), natural products (NPs) and traditional medicine (TM). PFH was also examined separately from CAM to better characterise the patterns of CAM and PFH used during chemotherapy. Results: A total of 546 eligible patients participated in the study; 70.7% (n = 386) reported using some form of CAM, and 29.3% (n = 160) were non-CAM users. When PFH was excluded as a CAM, fewer patients reported the use of CAM (66.1%; n = 361). The total number of patients who used MBPs decreased from 342 to 183. The most common CAM use category was NPs (82.8%), followed by MBPs (50.7%), and TM (35.7%). CAM users were more likely to have a tertiary education (OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.15-3.89 vs. primary/lower), have household incomes > RM 3,000 (≈944 USD) per month (OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.40-3.84 vs. ≤RM 3,000 (≈944 USD)), and have advanced cancer (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.18-2.59 vs. early stage cancer), compared with non-CAM users. The CAM users were less likely to have their chemotherapy on schedule (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.10-0.58 vs. chemotherapy postponed) than non-CAM users. Most MBPs were perceived to be more helpful by their users, compared with the users of NPs and TM. Conclusion: CAM use was prevalent among breast cancer patients. Excluding PFH from the definition of CAM reduced the prevalence of overall CAM use. Overall, CAM use was associated with higher education levels and household incomes, advanced cancer and lower chemotherapy schedule compliance. Many patients perceived MBP to be beneficial for improving overall well-being during chemotherapy. These findings, while preliminary, clearly indicate the differences in CAM use when PFH is included in, and excluded from, the definition of CAM. © 2014 Chui et al.},

abstract={Background: Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst Malaysian women. Both the disease and its treatment can disrupt the lives of the woman and adversely affect all aspects of life and thus can alter a woman's quality of life. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of virgin coconut oil (VCO) on the quality of life (QOL) of patients diagnosed with breast cancer. Methods: This was a prospective study of breast cancer patients admitted into the Oncology Unit of Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kubang Kerian, Kelantan, Malaysia. The sample consisted of 60 patients with stage III and IV breast cancer allocated to either an intervention group (n = 30) or a control group (n = 30) using a simple random table. QOL was evaluated from the first cycle of chemotherapy to the sixth cycle, and data were collected using a validated Bahasa Malaysia version of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Breast Cancer Module (EORTC QLQ-C30) and its breast-specific module (QLQ-BR 23). Results: The mean age of breast cancer patients was 50.2 (SD = 13.5) years. There were significant mean score differences for functioning and global QOL between groups (α < 0.01). The intervention group also had better scores for symptoms including fatigue, dyspnea, sleep difficulties, and loss of appetite compared to the control group. Although there are deteriorations for sexual enjoyment, the intervention group exhibited improvement in breast functioning and symptom scores for body image, sexual function, future perspective, breast symptoms, and systemic therapy side effects. Conclusion: VCO consumption during chemotherapy helped improve the functional status and global QOL of breast cancer patients. In addition, it reduced the symptoms related to side effects of chemotherapy. © 2014 Law et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Within a setting without organised breast cancer screening, the characteristics and survival of very early breast cancer were determined. Methods: All 4930 women diagnosed with breast cancer in University Malaya Medical Center, Malaysia from 1993 to 2011 were included. Factors associated with very early presentation (stage I) at diagnosis were identified. Tumour characteristics, management patterns, and survival of very early breast cancer were described, and where appropriate, compared with other settings. Results: Proportion of women presenting with stage I breast cancer significantly increased from 15.2% to 25.2% over two decades. Factors associated with very early presentation were Chinese ethnicity, positive family history of breast cancer, and recent period of diagnosis. Within stage I breast cancers, median tumour size at presentation was 1.5 cm. A majority of stage I breast cancer patients received mastectomy, which was associated with older age, Chinese ethnicity, postmenopausal status, and larger tumours. Chemotherapy was administered in 36% of patients. Five-year age-adjusted relative survival for women with stage I breast cancer was 99.1% (95% CI: 97.6-99.6%). Conclusions: The proportion of women presenting with very early breast cancer in this setting without organised screening is increasing. These women seem to survive just as well as their counterparts from affluent settings.© 2014 Cancer Research UK. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background: In Asia, up to 25% of breast cancer patients present with distant metastases at diagnosis. Given the heterogeneous survival probabilities of de novo metastatic breast cancer, individual outcome prediction is challenging. The aim of the study is to identify existing prognostic models for patients with de novo metastatic breast cancer and validate them in Asia. Materials and Methods: We performed a systematic review to identify prediction models for metastatic breast cancer. Models were validated in 642 women with de novo metastatic breast cancer registered between 2000 and 2010 in the Singapore Malaysia Hospital Based Breast Cancer Registry. Survival curves for low, intermediate and high-risk groups according to each prognostic score were compared by log-rank test and discrimination of the models was assessed by concordance statistic (C-statistic). Results: We identified 16 prediction models, seven of which were for patients with brain metastases only. Performance status, estrogen receptor status, metastatic site(s) and disease-free interval were the most common predictors. We were able to validate nine prediction models. The capacity of the models to discriminate between poor and good survivors varied from poor to fair with C-statistics ranging from 0.50 (95% CI, 0.48-0.53) to 0.63 (95% CI, 0.60-0.66). Conclusion: The discriminatory performance of existing prediction models for de novo metastatic breast cancer in Asia is modest. Development of an Asian-specific prediction model is needed to improve prognostication and guide decision making. © 2014 Miao et al.},

abstract={Background: Cancer is the leading cause of deaths in the world. A widening disparity in cancer burden has emerged between high income and low-middle income countries. Closing this cancer divide is an ethical imperative but there is a dearth of data on cancer services from developing countries.Methods: This was a multi-center, retrospective observational cohort study which enrolled women with breast cancer (BC) attending 8 participating cancer centers in Malaysia in 2011. All patients were followed up for 12 months from diagnosis to determine their access to therapies. We assess care performance using measures developed by Quality Oncology Practice Initiative, American Society of Clinical Oncology/National Comprehensive Cancer Network, American College of Surgeons' National Accreditation Program for Breast Centers as well as our local guideline.Results: Seven hundred and fifty seven patients were included in the study; they represent about 20% of incident BC in Malaysia. Performance results were mixed. Late presentation was 40%. Access to diagnostic and breast surgery services were timely; the interval from presentation to tissue diagnosis was short (median = 9 days), and all who needed surgery could receive it with only a short wait (median = 11 days). Performance of radiation, chemo and hormonal therapy services showed that about 75 to 80% of patients could access these treatments timely, and those who could not were because they sought alternative treatment or they refused treatment. Access to Trastuzumab was limited to only 19% of eligible patients.Conclusions: These performance results are probably acceptable for a middle income country though far below the 95% or higher adherence rates routinely reported by centres in developed countries. High cost trastuzumab was inaccessible to this population without public funding support. © 2014 Lim et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Breast cancer is the most common cause of deaths and the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women worldwide. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of breast cancer screening, specifically on clinical breast examination, and the predictors of its uptake among women in Malaysia. A cross-sectional study was carried out in five selected districts whereby women aged between 20 to 64 years old, from a total of 1000 households were interviewed. A total of 1192 women responded to the survey of which 53.3% reported had ever done clinical breast examination. Significant associations with clinical breast examination were noted for income and distance from the hospital. These factors should be considered in developing interventions aimed at promoting clinical breast examination. In particular, healthcare providers should be proactive in raising awareness about clinical breast examination among women in Malaysia. © 2014 Nik Farid et al.},

abstract={Background: Dietary carbohydrate, fiber and sugar intake has been shown to play a role in the etiology of breast cancer, but the findings have been inconsistent and limited to developed countries with higher cancer incidence. Objective: To examine the association of premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer risk with dietary carbohydrate, fiber and sugar intake. Materials and Methods: This population based case-control study was conducted in Malaysia with 382 breast cancer patients and 382 controls. Food intake pattern was assessed via an interviewer-administered food frequency questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to compute odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and a broad range of potential confounders were included in analysis. Results: A significant two fold increased risk of breast cancer among premenopausal (OR Q4 to Q1=1.93, 95%CI: 1.53-2.61, p-trend=0.001) and postmenopausal (OR Q4 to Q1=1.87, 95%CI: 1.03-2.61, p-trend=0.045) women was observed in the highest quartile of sugar. A higher intake of dietary fiber was associated with a significantly lower breast cancer risk among both premenopausal (ORQ4 to Q1=0.31, 95%CI: 0.12-0.79, p-trend=0.009) and postmenopausal (ORQ4 to Q1=0.23, 95%CI: 0.07-0.76, p-trend=0.031) women. Conclusions: Sugar and dietary fiber intake were independently related to pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer risk. However, no association was observed for dietary carbohydrate intake.},

abstract={Four hundred and nineteen articles related to breast cancer were found in a search through a database dedicated to indexing all original data relevant to medicine published in Malaysia between the years 2000-2013. One hundred and fifty four articles were selected and reviewed on the basis of clinical relevance and future research implications. Overall, Malaysian women have poor survival from breast cancer and it is estimated that half of the deaths due to breast cancer could be prevented. Five-year survival in Malaysia was low and varies among different institutions even within the same disease stage, suggesting an inequity of access to optimal treatment or a lack of compliance to optimal treatment. Malaysian women have poor knowledge of the risk factors, symptoms and methods for early detection of breast cancer, leading to late presentation. Moreover, Malaysian women experience cancer fatalism, belief in alternative medicine, and lack of autonomy in decision making resulting in delays in seeking or avoidance of evidence-based medicine. There are ethnic differences in estrogen receptor status, HER2 overexpression and incidence of triple negative breast cancer which warrant further investigation. Malay women present with larger tumours and at later stages, and even after adjustment for these and other prognostic factors (stage, pathology and treatment), Malay women have a poorer survival. Although the factors responsible for these ethnic differences have not been elucidated, it is thought that pharmacogenomics, lifestyle factors (such as weight-gain, diet and exercise), and psychosocial factors (such as acceptance of 2nd or 3rd line chemotherapy) may be responsible for the difference in survival. Notably, survivorship studies show self-management programmes and exercise improve quality of life, highlighting the need to evaluate the psychosocial impact of breast cancer on Malaysian women, and to design culturally-, religiouslyand linguistically-appropriate psycho-education programmes to help women cope with the disease and improve their quality of life. Research done in the Caucasian populations may not necessarily apply to local settings and it is important to embark on local studies particularly prevention, screening, diagnostic, prognostic, therapeutic and psychosocial research. © 2014 Malaysian Medical Association.

abstract={Background: Advanced breast cancer presentation remains a large obstacle in lowering mortality rates in low- and middle-resource countries. This study aims to explore the reasons why women present with breast cancer at an advanced stage. Methods: Purposive sampling of 19 breast cancer patients presenting with advanced cancer that were diagnosed within 2 years at the University Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. In-depth interviews were conducted, and audio-recordings were transcribed. Sample size was determined by theoretic sufficiency, and the constructivist grounded theory method was used. Results: The reasons for delayed presentation can be displayed in two models. The total breast cancer delay (TBCD) model was derived from the journey of the patients. Four concepts emerged: (1) pluralistic health systems; (2) points of delay; (3) presence of patient or system delays, and (4) patient decision-making at each stage. Eight points of delay were found. At each point, evidence of a patient decision-making model emerged: the breast cancer delay explanatory (BCDE) model, which was the process of assessing severity and knowing and choosing options. The four main operational constructs were (1) knowledge on disease and disease outcomes, (2) knowledge of treatment and treatment outcomes, (3) psychological and physical resources and support; and (4) roles in decision-making. Conclusions: The phenomenon is explained by the TBCD and BCDE models. Deconstructing why women present with advanced breast cancer and resist treatment provides clarity of the issues and opportunities for intervention. © 2013 Société Internationale de Chirurgie.},

abstract={Background: This study aimed to provide an overview of lifestyle changes after breast cancer diagnosis and to examine the relationship between dietary and physical activity changes with weight changes in breast cancer patients. Women with breast carcinomas (n=368) were recruited from eight hospitals and four breast cancer support groups in peninsular Malaysia. Dietary and physical activity changes were measured from a year preceding breast cancer diagnosis to study entry. Mean duration since diagnosis was 4.86±3.46 years. Dietary changes showed that majority of the respondents had decreased their intake of high fat foods (18.8-65.5%), added fat foods (28.3-48.9%), low fat foods (46.8-80.7%), red meat (39.7%), pork and poultry (20.1-39.7%) and high sugar foods (42.1-60.9%) but increased their intake of fish (42.7%), fruits and vegetables (62.8%) and whole grains (28.5%). Intake of other food groups remained unchanged. Only a small percentage of the women (22.6%) had increased their physical activity since diagnosis where most of them (16.0%) had increased recreational activities. Age at diagnosis (β= -0.20, p= 0.001), and change in whole grain (β= -0.15, p= 0.003) and fish intakes (β= 0.13, p= 0.013) were associated with weight changes after breast cancer diagnosis. In summary, the majority of the women with breast cancer had changed their diets to a healthier one. However, many did not increase their physical activity levels which could improve their health and lower risk of breast cancer recurrence.},

abstract={The incidence of breast cancer in Malaysia and other Asian countries is on the increase, reflecting lifestyle changes some of which are known risk factors for the development of breast cancer. Most breast cancers are amenable to adjuvant therapies that target hormone receptors or HER2 receptors on the surface of the cancer cells and bring about significant improvement in survival. However, approximately 17% of Malaysian women with breast cancer, present with tumours that are devoid of these receptors and are consequently termed ‘triple negative’ breast cancers. These triple negative breast cancers typically occur in women of a younger age than receptor positive cancers, are predominantly of high grade tumours and the prognosis is usually poor. There is therefore a pressing need to understand the biological pathways that drive these tumours, in order that effective strategies are developed to treat these aggressive tumours. With the increasing affluence of developing countries, obesity and Type II Diabetes are also on the rise. These diseases are associated with an increased risk of developing a range of cancers including those of the breast. In particular, the metabolic syndrome has been shown to be associated with triple negative breast cancer. This article reviews some of the metabolic pathways and biomarkers which have been shown to be aberrantly expressed in triple negative breast cancer and highlights some of the ongoing work in this area. © 2014, Malaysian Society of Pathologists.

abstract={Objective: To provide an overview of the incidence and mortality of female breast cancer for countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Methods: Statistical information about breast cancer was obtained from publicly available cancer registry and mortality databases (such as GLOBOCAN), and supplemented with data requested from individual cancer registries. Rates were directly age-standardised to the Segi World Standard population and trends were analysed using joinpoint models. Results: Breast cancer was the most common type of cancer among females in the region, accounting for 18% of all cases in 2012, and was the fourth most common cause of cancer-related deaths (9%). Although incidence rates remain much higher in New Zealand and Australia, rapid rises in recent years were observed in several Asian countries. Large increases in breast cancer mortality rates also occurred in many areas, particularly Malaysia and Thailand, in contrast to stabilising trends in Hong Kong and Singapore, while decreases have been recorded in Australia and New Zealand. Mortality trends tended to be more favourable for women aged under 50 compared to those who were 50 years or older. Conclusion: It is anticipated that incidence rates of breast cancer in developing countries throughout the Asia-Pacific region will continue to increase. Early detection and access to optimal treatment are the keys to reducing breast cancer-related mortality, but cultural and economic obstacles persist. Consequently, the challenge is to customise breast cancer control initiatives to the particular needs of each country to ensure the best possible outcomes.

abstract={Data analysis based on breast cancer risk factors such as age, race, breastfeeding, hormone replacement therapy, family history, and obesity was conducted on breast cancer patients using a new enhanced computerized database management system. My Structural Query Language (MySQL) is selected as the application for database management system to store the patient data collected from hospitals in Malaysia. An automatic calculation tool is embedded in this system to assist the data analysis. The results are plotted automatically and a user-friendly graphical user interface is developed that can control the MySQL database. Case studies show breast cancer incidence rate is highest among Malay women, followed by Chinese and Indian. The peak age for breast cancer incidence is from 50 to 59 years old. Results suggest that the chance of developing breast cancer is increased in older women, and reduced with breastfeeding practice. The weight status might affect the breast cancer risk differently. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings. © 2014 Sim et al.; licensee Springer.},

abstract={Background: Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer prevalent among women worldwide. Preventive behaviors such as early diagnosis through screening tests play an important role in prevention and control of the disease. This study aimed to determine the effects of educational intervention using a health belief model on breast cancer preventive behaviors. Method: This interventional study was conducted on 130 female employees of Zahedan University of Medical Sciences who were randomly divided into intervention and control groups. A questionnaire, made and validated by the researcher, was completed before and one month after training by the study subjects. Data were analysed using regression analysis, independent sample T-test, chi-square and Pearson's correlation coefficient using the SPSS software 18. Result: There were significant changes in the training group, following educational intervention in the awareness construct and in some constructs of the model including perceived susceptibility, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers, as well as in practice compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Nevertheless, perceived barriers remained as the only predictor in the model, such that for every unit increase in this variable, the behavior score increased by 18%. Conclusion: The use of educational intervention based on Health Belief Model had positive effect on knowledge of breast cancer preventive behaviors among participants. © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2014.},

abstract={Introduction The period of the cancer patients undergoing treatment is also the most stressful time for their family caregivers. This study aimed to determine the rates of major depressive disorder and dysthymia; and their associated factors in the caregivers during this time. Methods One hundred and thirty caregiver-patient dyads attending the oncology centre for breast cancer treatment participated in this cross-sectional study. While the data on the patients' socio-demographic and illness characteristics were obtained from their medical record, the caregivers completed three self-report measures: 1) socio-demography and the caregiving factor questionnaire, 2) Multi-dimensional Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) and 3) Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Subsequently, those with "probable depression" identified from the DASS-21 score were interviewed using The Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) to obtain the diagnoses of depressive disorders. Results Twenty-three of the 130 caregivers (17.69%) were diagnosed to have depressive disorders, where 12.31% (n = 16) had major depressive disorder and 5.38% (n = 7) had dysthymic disorder. Factors associated with depression include ethnicity, duration of caregiving, the patients' functional status and the caregivers' education level. Logistic regression analysis showed that the patients' functional status (p < 0.05, OR = 0.23, CI = 0.06-0.86) and the caregivers' education level (p < 0.05, CI = 9.30, CI = 1.82-47.57) were significantly associated with depression in the caregivers attending to breast cancer patients on oncology treatment. Conclusions A significant proportion of family caregivers were clinically depressed while caring for their loved ones. Depression in this population is a complex interplay between the patients' factors and the caregivers' factors. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background: In settings with limited resources, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) is only offered to breast cancer patients with small tumors and a low a priori risk of axillary metastases. Objective: We investigated whether CancerMath, a free online prediction tool for axillary lymph node involvement, is able to identify women at low risk of axillary lymph node metastases in Malaysian women with 3-5 cm tumors, with the aim to offer SNB in a targeted, cost-effective way. Methods: Women with non-metastatic breast cancers, measuring 3-5 cm were identified within the University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) breast cancer registry. We compared CancerMath-predicted probabilities of lymph node involvement between women with versus without lymph node metastases. The discriminative performance of CancerMath was tested using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results: Out of 1,017 patients, 520 (51 %) had axillary involvement. Tumors of women with axillary involvement were more often estrogen-receptor positive, progesterone-receptor positive, and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2 positive. The mean CancerMath score was higher in women with axillary involvement than in those without (53.5 vs. 51.3, p = 0.001). In terms of discrimination, CancerMath performed poorly, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.553 (95 % confidence interval CI 0.518-0.588). Attempts to optimize the CancerMath model by adding ethnicity and HER2 to the model did not improve discriminatory performance. Conclusion: For Malaysian women with tumors measuring 3-5 cm, CancerMath is unable to accurately predict lymph node involvement and is therefore not helpful in the identification of women at low risk of node-positive disease who could benefit from SNB. © 2014 Société Internationale de Chirurgie.},

abstract={Background: Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) plus radiotherapy is equivalent to modified radical mastectomy (MRM) in terms of outcome. However there is wide variation in mastectomy rates dependent both on tumour and patient characteristics. Objective: This study aimed to assess the determinants of surgery choice in Asian patients with early breast cancer in a middle-income country. Materials and Methods: 184 patients with early breast cancer treated between Jan 2008 and Dec 2010 were recruited to complete a questionnaire. Chi-square test was used to analyze the association between surgery choice and demographic and tumour factors, surgeon recommendation, family member and partner opinions, fear of recurrence, avoidance of second surgery, fear of disfigurement, interference with sex life, fear of radiation and loss of femininity. Results: 85 (46%) had BCS while 99 (54%) had mastectomy. Age >60, Chinese ethnicity, lower education level, and larger tumour size were significantly associated with mastectomy. Surgeon recommendation was important in surgery choice. Although both groups did not place much importance on interference with sex life, 14.1% of the BCS group felt it was very important compared to 5.1% in the mastectomy group and this was statistically significant. There was no statistical difference between the two groups in terms of the other factors. When analyzed by ethnicity, significantly more Malay and Indian women considered partner and family member opinions very important and were more concerned about loss of femininity compared to Chinese women. There were no statistical differences between the three ethnic groups in terms of the other factors. Conclusions: When counseling on surgical options, the surgeon has to take into account the ethnicity, social background and education level, age and reliance on partner and family members. Decision-making is usually a collective effort rather than just between the patient and surgeon, and involving the whole family into the process early is important.},

abstract={Although the breast cancer predisposition genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 were discovered more than 20 years ago, there remains a gap in the availability of genetic counselling and genetic testing in Asian countries because of cost, access and inaccurate reporting of family history of cancer. In order to improve access to testing, we developed a rapid test for recurrent mutations in our Asian populations. In this study, we designed a genotyping assay with 55 BRCA1 and 44 BRCA2 mutations previously identified in Asian studies, and validated this assay in 267 individuals who had previously been tested by full sequencing. We tested the prevalence of these mutations in additional breast cancer cases. Using this genotyping approach, we analysed recurrent mutations in 533 Malaysian breast cancer cases with <10% a priori risk, and found 1 BRCA1 (0.2%) and 5 BRCA2 (0.9%) carriers. Testing in a hospital-based unselected cohort of 532 Singaporean breast cancer cases revealed 6 BRCA1 (1.1%) and 3 BRCA2 (0.6%) carriers. Overall, 2 recurrent BRCA1 and 1 BRCA2 mutations in Malays, 3 BRCA1 and 2 BRCA2 mutations in Chinese and 1 BRCA1 mutation in Indians account for 60, 24 and 20% of carrier families, respectively. By contrast, haplotype analyses suggest that a recurrent BRCA2 mutation (c.262-263delCT) found in 5 unrelated Malay families has at least 3 distinct haplotypes. Taken together, our data suggests that panel testing may help to identify carriers, particularly Asian BRCA2 carriers, who do not present with a priori strong family history characteristics. © Springer Science+Business Media 2014.},

abstract={Background: The risk of febrile neutropaenia (FN) and treatment related death (TRD) with first line palliative chemotherapy for de novo metastatic breast cancer (MBC) remains unknown outside of a clinical trial setting despite its widespread usage. This study aimed to determine rates in a large cohort of patients treated in the University of Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC). Materials and Methods: Patients who were treated with first line palliative chemotherapy for de novo MBC from 2002-2011 in UMMC were identified from the UMMC Breast Cancer Registry. Information collected included patient demographics, histopathological features, treatment received, including the different chemotherapy regimens, and presence of FN and TRD. FN was defined as an oral temperature &gt; 38.5°C or two consecutive readings of &gt; 38.0°C for 2 hours and an absolute neutrophil count &lt; 0.5×109/L, or expected to fall below 0.5×109/L (de Naurois et al, 2010). TRD was defined as death occurring during or within 30 days of the last chemotherapy treatment, as a consequence of the chemotherapy treatment. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS version 18.0 software. Survival probabilities were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and differences in survival compared using log-rank test. Results: Between 1st January 2002 and 31st December 2011, 424 patients with MBC were treated in UMMC. A total of 186 out of 221 patients with de novo MBC who received first line palliative chemotherapy were analyzed. The mean age of patients in this study was 49.5 years (range 24 to 74 years). Biologically, ER status was negative in 54.4% of patients and Her-2 status was positive in 31.1%. A 5-flourouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (FEC) chemotherapy regimen was chosen for 86.6% of the cases. Most patients had multiple metastatic sites (58.6%). The main result of this study showed a FN rate of 5.9% and TRD rate of 3.2%. The median survival (MS) for the entire cohort was 19 months. For those with multiple metastatic sites, liver only, lung only, bone only and brain only metastatic sites, the MS was 18, 24, 19, 24 and 8 months respectively (p-value= 0.319). Conclusions: In conclusion, we surmise that FEC is a safe regimen with acceptable FN and TRD rates for de novo MBC.},

abstract={Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer of women all over the world. BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations comprise the most important genetic susceptibility of BC. Except for few common mutations, the spectrum of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations is heterogeneous in diverse populations. 185AGdel and 5382insC are the most important BRCA1 and BRCA2 alterations which have been encountered in most of the populations. After those Ashkenazi founder mutations, 300T>G also demonstrated sparse frequency in African American and European populations. This review affords quick access to the most frequent alterations among various populations which could be helpful in BRCA screening programs. © 2013 Fatemeh Karami and Parvin Mehdipour.},

abstract={Background: Little is known on the impact of ethnicity on survival after breast cancer in the multi-ethnic Asian setting. Methods: Using the multi-institutional Singapore-Malaysia hospital-based breast cancer registry, we investigated the association between ethnicity and risk of mortality after breast cancer in 3,366 patients diagnosed between 1990 and 2007 (Chinese: 77%, Malay: 15%, Indian: 8%). Kaplan- Meier analysis was used to estimate overall cumulative survival (OS). Multivariable hazard ratios (HR) adjusted for tumor and treatment characteristics were computed using Cox regression analysis after splitting follow-up time along the age-axis and calendar-time axis. Results: Malay patients presented at younger age compared to Chinese and Indians (47years vs 52years vs 53years, respectively, p<0.001) with larger tumors (35mm vs 24mm vs 30mm, respectively, p<0.001), and at later stages (TNM stage III or IV) (37% vs 23% vs 25%, respectively, p<0.001). Malay women were least likely to have undergone surgery, and most likely to receive chemotherapy. Five-year OS was 71.9 (95% CI: 69.7-74.1) in Chinese, 47.2% (95%CI: 41.9-52.5) in Malays and 62.7 (56.0-69.4) in Indians. After adjustment for stage, tumor characteristics and treatment, Malays patients had approximately 60% higher risk of death than the Chinese (HR:1.57; 95%CI:1.40-1.77). Indian ethnicity was not significantly associated with risk of mortality after breast cancer compared to Chinese (HR:1.12; 95%CI: 0.98-1.30). Conclusion: In the Asian setting, Malay ethnicity seems to be associated with significantly poorer survival after breast cancer, independent of stage, tumor and treatment profile. The underlying reasons for this association are unclear but may be explained by variations in susceptibility to treatment, co-morbidity and lifestyle after diagnosis of breast cancer.},

abstract={Background: Breast cancer is the commonest type of cancer among women, and in Malaysia 50-60% of the new cases are being detected at late stages. Do age, education level, income, ethnicity, relationship with breast cancer patients and knowledge of breast cancer risk factors influence breast screening practices? This study revealed interesting but significant differences. Objectives: To assess the knowledge of breast cancer risk factors and early detection measures among women in a high risk group. Materials and Methods: A cross sectional survey of one hundred and thirty one women relatives of breast cancer patients was carried out. Participants were selected through purposive sampling, during hospital visits. A self-administered questionnaire was used for data collection. Results: The majority of the respondents (71%) had poor knowledge of the risk factors for breast cancer. Income, relationship with a patient and practise of breast cancer screening predicted performance of mammography, R2=0.467, F=12.568, p&lt;0.0001. Conclusions: The finding shows inadequate knowledge of breast cancer risk factors and poor cancer screening practise among women with family history of breast cancer. Poor knowledge and practise of breast screening are likely to lead to late stage presentation of breast cancer disease. Some important predictors of breast cancer screening behaviour among women with positive family history of breast cancer were identified. An understanding of the strengths and significance of the association between these factors and breast screening behaviour is vital for developing more targeted breast health promotion.},

abstract={In Malaysia, about 25% of patients with breast cancer present with either locally advanced or metastatic disease. In the management of these patients, the dilemma that most surgeons have is whether to do a toilet mastectomy or primary chemotherapy/ occasionally, these patients have infected fungating lesions and the concern exists for development of sepsis during primary chemotherapy, or disease progression during treatment. It is also not uncommon for patients with benign phyllodes to present with large tumours. In University Malaya Medical Centre, we will excise these lesions with clear gross margin and cover the large defect using local abdominal advancement flap in combination with a latissmus dorsi flap to cover the defect. Mastectomy and axillary clearance and harvesting of the flap are performed concurrently by two separate surgeons with the patient in the lateral position. The median size of tumour excised was 11 cm. Clear microscopic margins were obtained in 64% of the patients, close in 9% and involved margins in 27%. One patients (9%) developed local recurrence around the flap as she refused radiotherapy post-operatively. We conclude that this technique is simple and safe to be performed by a general surgeon and improves the quality of life of these patients and allows them to proceed with chemotherapy and radiotherapy.},

abstract={Background: Breast cancer is the most common cancer among Malaysian women. Previous studies reported there is disparity of breast cancer survivorship among Malaysian patients. Breast cancer is a multifactorial disease- that is due to complex combination and interaction of different factors such as disease clinic-pathological features, ethnicity, health behaviors, lifestyle, genes and environment. However, the study about its interaction and impact on patient survivor is still inadequate. The Malaysian Breast Cancer Cohort (MyBCC) is a prospective cohort study which aims to identify the association between genetics, lifestyle and nutrition on overall survival and quality of life of Malaysian Breast Cancer patients. It is a collaboration project with Queens University of Belfast, United of Kingdom and funded by Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia since 2011. Methods: In MyBCC, detailed information about each patient including clinic-pathological features, quality of life, psycho-social support, physical activity, complementary and alternative medicine used, occupation and finance will be collected along with tissue, blood and urine samples. Patients will be followed up routinely up to 3 years. The participations of the breast cancer patients will be voluntary. The project aims to recruit at least 1000 Malaysian Breast Cancer patients who visit to University of Malaya Medical Centre and representing various ethnic groups, cultures, occupation and lifestyles. Discussion: The UM Cancer Research Institute (UMCRi) biobank served as key infrastructure in MyBCC. Biobank would support long-term storage of blood, serum, plasma, tissue and urine for future potential researches. MyBCC, therefore, represents the resource and opportunity to investigate the factors that affecting the patients' survivor by analyzing the answers, measurements, and biospecimen collected from patients.},

abstract={Purpose and relevance: The prevalence of advanced presentation remains a large obstacle to achieving lower mortality rates in low and middle resource countries. Research on the reasons for late presentation is scarce in the Asia Pacific region. This study aims to provide clarity in the reasons why women present their breast cancer at an advanced stage. Method: Purposive sampling of 19 breast cancer patients presenting with delayed treatment and/or advanced cancer diagnosed within two years at the University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC), Kuala Lumpur. In-depth interviews were conducted using a topic guide. The audio-recordings were transcribed verbatim. NVivo 8 qualitative software was utilised for data management. Triangulation with patients' medical notes was done. The sample size was determined by theoretical sufficiency a constructivist grounded theory method was utilised. Reflexively the main researcher is a breast surgeon who was not involved in the medical care of the patients. Results: The constructs were derived from the journey of the patients. Through an iterative process, evidenced by thick description, two models emerged. The first was the stages of breast cancer delay (SBCD) model where four concepts emerged :- i) pluralistic health systems; ii) stages or points of delay; iii) presence of patient or system delays and lastly iv) patient decision making at each stage. Eight points or stages of delay were found :- (i) Appraisal delay; (ii) Disclosure delay; (iii) Illness delay; (iv)Behavioural/ Referral Delay; (v) Scheduling delay; (vi) Diagnostic delay and (vii)Treatment decision delay and viii) Treatment delay. At each stage, a patient decision making model emerged, the breast cancer delay explanatory (BCDE) model, which was the process of assessing severity, knowing options and choosing options. Four main constructs found to be operational here were; i) knowledge on disease and disease outcomes, ii) knowledge on treatment and treatment outcomes, iii) psychological and physical resources and support and lastly iv) roles in patient and medical decision making. Conclusion: The theoretical framework on why women present to medical authorities with advanced disease emerged from the constructivist grounded theory. Deconstructing this complex phenomenon, and understanding the breast cancer patients allows for clarity of the issues and opportunities for interventions. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Medical Ethical Committee of University Malaya Medical Centre MEC 655.7. The study was funded by Vote F FS2252008 Ministry of Higher Education.},

abstract={Introduction: To date, more than 20 genes and 65 genetic loci have been proposed to cause an increased risk to breast cancer. However, although Asians constitute more than 60% of the world's populations, relatively little is known about the prevalence and penetrance of BRCA mutations or mutations in other breast cancer predisposition genes, and the uptake and utility of genetic testing in Asian populations, particularly in low and middle income Asian countries. For BRCA1 and BRCA2, this is in large part because the cost of genetic testing has limited its availability in medium- and low-resource countries, and to date, the majority of testing has been funded through research and charitable funding. Here, we report an update of the results of genetic testing and clinical management of patients for BRCA1 and BRCA2, and the results of testing other breast cancer predisposition genes in the Malaysian Breast Cancer Genetic Study [MyBrCa] and describe the clinical presentation of individuals high-risk for BRCA mutations. Methodology: Since January 2003, a cohort of incident and prevalent breast cancer patients treated at the Breast Cancer Unit at the University Malaya Faculty of Medicine has been established. As of December 2012, a total of 1741 patients have been recruited, of whom 487 patients with earlyonset breast cancer and/or a personal and/or family history of breast or ovarian cancer have been fully analysed for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. Mutations identified in this and other Asian studies were subsequently tested in a population-based cohort of ~1,500 Chinese, Malay and Indian patients with invasive breast cancer cases and ~1,500 non-cancer controls by genotyping. Free genetic counseling and genetic testing was offered to all index and 1° and 2° relatives. Main findings: 1. We have shown that similar to that in other populations, BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are associated with early age of onset and family history of breast and ovarian cancer [Toh et al., PlosOne 2008]. However, although there is strong association with age and family history, the risk assessment models which were built on Caucasian populations based on these variables severely under predicted the number of carriers in Asians, suggesting that there is a strong need to develop or calibrate risk assessment models for Asians [Thirthagiri et al., Breast Cancer Research 2008]. 2. We reported that BRCA1 carriers are more likely to develop ER- breast cancer and the majority develop triple negative breast cancer [Yip et al., World J Surgery 2009]. More recently, we have shown that triple negative breast cancer is a significant predictor of BRCA mutations in early onset breast cancer patients and in those with significant family history, but may have limited utility in patients with isolated late-onset breast cancer [Phuah et al., Breast Cancer Res 2012]. 3. Of the mutations we have detected, we find that a small proportion are recurrent [including the BRCA1 185delAG mutation, Laitman et al., 2012] and we have used this information to develop a rapid and cost-effective genotyping strategy for detection of mutations [Kang et al., in prep]. In addition to point mutations and small insertions/deletions, we have found that large genomic rearrangements in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 constitute ~10% of the mutations found [Kang et al., Breast Cancer Res Treat 2010]. 4. Notably, a significant proportion of mutations identified are novel and many are variants for which there is little functional or genetic studies to determine whether they are clinically relevant. We have analysed the clinical relevant of Malaysian and other Asian mutations in a case control study [Kang et al., in prep] and in collaboration with the ENIGMA consortium, are developing methodologies for the classification of other variants [Spurdle et al., Human Mut 2012]. Notably, functional analysis of one of the BRCA1 variants conducted in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute USA uncovered a novel function for BRCA1 [Chang et al., Nature Medicine 2011]. 5. We reported that genetic counseling and genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 are generally acceptable to Asian patients, although there is a gap in the provision of such services throughout Asia [Yoon et al., Familial Cancer 2010]. All patients and their relatives with clinically significant mutations are offered clinical follow up and a significant proportion take up screening or risk-reducing surgery [Nur Aishah et al., in prep]. 6. In collaboration with the IMPACT international collaborative group, we have shown that men with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are at increased risk to prostate cancer and furthermore, that PSA is a sensitive and specific screening tool [Mitra et al., BJU Int 2011]. 7. In collaboration with CIMBA, an international consortium of investigators of modifiers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 penetrance, we have determined the lifestyle and genetic modifiers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 [Antoniou et al., Hum Mol Genetics 2011; Ramus et al., Human Mutation 2012; Antoniou et al., Breast Cancer Res 2012; Couch et al., Cancer Epi Prevention Biomarkers 2012]. More recently, this Consortium has conducted a larger genome-wide study and the results are being reviewed [Antoniou et al., submitted; Zheng et al., submitted]. 8. In collaboration with the Breast Cancer Association Consortium, we have identified 42 new loci that contribute to an increased risk to breast cancer [Garcia-Closas et al., Nature Genetics 2013; Michailidou et al., Nature Genetics 2013], and 11 new loci that contribute to an increased risk to ovarian cancer [Pharoah et al., Nature Genetics 2013]. 9. In addition to BRCA1 and BRCA2, we have studied the significance of germline mutations in other genes, including CHEK2 [Thirthagiri et al., Familial Cancer 2009], TP53 [Lee et al., Breast Cancer Res 2012], PALB2 [Phuah et al., in prep], and ATM [Mariapun et al., in prep]. More recently, we have embarked on a pilot study to determine the mutations of 20 genes in 1,000 individuals [Sivanandan et al., in prep] and to use whole genome sequencing to identify novel breast cancer genes in families with 4 or more cases of breast cancer but do not have mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Conclusion: In summary, since 2003, the Malaysian Breast Cancer Genetic Study, a collaborative effort between the Breast Cancer Research Unit at University Malaya and Cancer Research Initiatives Foundation, has uncovered the genes that contribute to an increased risk to breast cancer and the team has begun to use translate this information to the clinic to benefit breast cancer patients and their families.},

abstract={The Use of Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a common phenomenon among women with breast cancer in Malaysia. This study examines the prevalence, types, influencing factors and source of information regarding CAM among women with breast cancer, using a cross sectional research design. A purposive sampling was used to recruit 103 women with breast cancer who were attending follow up care at the Radiotherapy and Oncology unit of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre. Data was gathered through the use of self-administered questionnaires. Ninety one women identified themselves as CAM users while twelve were non users. Among the CAM users, 57(62.6%) were Malays, 27(29.7%) Chinese and 7(7.7%) Indians. The common types of CAM used were vitamins, nutritional supplements and traditional medicines (TM). CAM was used more frequently upon diagnosis (63.7%) and after completion of conventional treatment (97.8%). With regard to decision-making, most of the women (62.6%) did not make the decision to use CAM and were mostly influenced by their husband and mother (67%). Mother (71.4%), husband (67%), and relatives (56%) were the main sources of information and all values showed significant association with CAM use (p<0.05). Prevalence of CAM use, especially TM, was high among the Malay and Chinese ethnic groups. The lack of autonomy in decision-making by the women was the major reason for the use of CAM. The effectiveness and safety of using TM upon diagnosis and in combination with conventional cancer treatment are of concern to the breast surgeons, oncologist and the health care team.},

abstract={Background:The partner and localizer of breast cancer 2 (PALB2) is responsible for facilitating BRCA2-mediated DNA repair by serving as a bridging molecule, acting as the physical and functional link between the breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) and breast cancer 2 (BRCA2) proteins. Truncating mutations in the PALB2 gene are rare but are thought to be associated with increased risks of developing breast cancer in various populations.Methods:We evaluated the contribution of PALB2 germline mutations in 122 Asian women with breast cancer, all of whom had significant family history of breast and other cancers. Further screening for nine PALB2 mutations was conducted in 874 Malaysian and 532 Singaporean breast cancer patients, and in 1342 unaffected Malaysian and 541 unaffected Singaporean women.Results:By analyzing the entire coding region of PALB2, we found two novel truncating mutations and ten missense mutations in families tested negative for BRCA1/2-mutations. One additional novel truncating PALB2 mutation was identified in one patient through genotyping analysis. Our results indicate a low prevalence of deleterious PALB2 mutations and a specific mutation profile within the Malaysian and Singaporean populations. © 2013 Phuah et al.},

abstract={Many studies among caregivers of breast cancer patients have revealed that stress affects a significant proportion of this particular group. The situation among caregivers of breast cancer patients in Malaysia was however not known. This cross-sectional study aimed to determine the proportion of the family caregivers who experienced stress while caring for the breast cancer patients who were on oncologic treatment in Kuala Lumpur Hospital and factors which predict the stress among these caregivers. A total of 130 family caregiver-breast cancer patient dyads who were attending the Institute of Radiotherapy and Oncology, Kuala Lumpur Hospital during a 3-month study period were recruited by non-random sampling method. The caregivers' stress was measured using the stress domain of the depression, anxiety, stress scale (DASS-21) while other data obtained included the patients' and caregivers' socio demographic status, the patients' illness characteristics and the caregiving factors and the caregivers' perceived social support. About 1 in 4 (24.6%; n=32) caregivers of breast cancer patients were stressed. Duration of caregiving, sharing of caregiving burden, patients' age and patients' functionality were found to be significantly associated with stress (p value <0.05). All these factors, except for duration of caregiving, continue to be significant in the logistic regression analysis (p value <0.05). This study found that a high proportion of the family caregivers experienced stress. Identification of the predictors of stress among the caregivers may help in the prevention strategies of stress in this group of caregivers.},

abstract={Healthy Eating Index-2005 (HEI-2005), an index-based dietary pattern, has been shown to predict the risk of chronic diseases among Americans. This study aims to examine the ability of HEI-2005 in predicting the probability for risk of premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer among Malaysian women. Data from a case-control nutritional epidemiology study among 764 participants including 382 breast cancer cases and 382 healthy women were extracted and scored. Multivariate odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to evaluate the relationship between the risk of breast cancer and quartiles (Q) of HEI-2005 total scores and its component, whereas the risk prediction ability of HEI-2005 was investigated using diagnostics analysis. The results of this study showed that there is a significant reduction in the risk of breast cancer, with a higher HEI-2005 total score among premenopausal women (OR Q1 vs. Q4=0.34, 95% CI; 0.15-0.76) and postmenopausal women (OR Q1 vs. Q4=0.20, 95% CI; 0.06-0.63). However, HEI-2005 has a sensitivity of 56-60%, a specificity of 55-60%, and a positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 57-58%, which indicates a moderate ability to predict the risk of breast cancer according to menopausal status. The breast cancer incidence observed poorly agrees with risk outcomes from HEI-2005 as shown by low κ statistics (κ=0.15). In conclusion, although the total HEI-2005 scores were associated with a risk of breast cancer among Malaysian women, the ability of HEI-2005 to predict risk is poor as indicated by the diagnostic analysis. A local index-based dietary pattern, which is disease specific, is required to predict the risk of breast cancer among Malaysian women for early prevention.

abstract={Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women worldwide. The incidence of breast cancer in Malaysia is lower compared to international statistics, with peak occurrence in the age group between 50 to 59 years of age and mortality rates of 18.6%. Despite current diagnostic and prognostic methods, the outcome for individual subjects remain poor. This is in part due to breast cancers' wide genetic heterogeneity. Various platforms for genetics studies are now employed to determine the identity of these genetic abnormalities, including microarray methods like highdensity single-nucleotide-polymorphism (SNP) oligonucleotide arrays which combine the power of chromosomal comparative genomic hybridization (cCGH) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the offering of higher-resolution mappings. These platforms and their applications in highlighting the genomic alteration frameworks manifested in breast carcinoma will be discussed.},

abstract={Background: Treatment for breast cancer has improved dramatically over the decades. Nevertheless, modified radical mastectomy with axillary dissection remains the standard treatment for most patients, especially those with big tumours. The conventional technology is to use diathermy to cut and coagulate blood vessels. The Ultracision dissector has been widely used in laparoscopic surgery and is documented to be safe and fast for cutting and coagulating tissue. The aim of this study is to compare ultracision to electrocautery, looking in terms of amount of post operative drainage, duration of drain days, seroma formation and other complications. Methodology: This study was a prospective randomized control trial of modified radical mastectomy performed for breast cancer in Pusat Perubatan Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (PPUKM) between 1st June 2007 to 31st December 2008. Patients were randomized in two groups: group A (n = 20) underwent modified radical mastectomy using ultracision (UC) and group B (n = 20) with the conventional electrocautery (EC) method. Main outcome measures were amount of drainage and duration of drain days. An unpaired 2-tailed Student's t test and the ×2 test to compare the groups. Results: A total of 40 patients were involved in this study. The majority of patients were Malay (55%) followed by Chinese (35%), Indian (5%) and others (5%). The mean volume of drainage from the axilla in the EC group was significantly higher than UC group [489.5 versus 188.1 mls (p < 0.001)]. The mean volume of drainage from the breast and the total drainage from both the breast and axilla was also significantly higher in the EC group compared to UC [169.3 versus 58.8 mls (p = 0.004) and 663.7 versus 247.0 mls (p < 0.002) respectively]. The drainage consequently showed significant reduction in terms of drain days in the axilla [6 days versus 3 days (p < 0.002)] and the breast [3 days versus 2 days (p < 0.002)] in the UC compared to the EC. There was no significant complication in both arms. In conclusion, the use of ultracision able to reduce the amount of drainage and the number of drain days after performing modified radical mastectomy. In doing so, the use of this technology enable us to discharge patients earlier without significant morbidities.},

abstract={Background: Breast cancer patients often show an interest in making dietary changes after diagnosis of breast cancer to improve their health condition and prevent cancer recurrence. Objective: The objective of the study was to determine changes in dietary intake 2 years after diagnosis among breast cancer patients. Methods: One hundred sixteen subjects were asked to complete a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire, diet recalls, and dietary changes questionnaire to assess dietary intake before and after diagnosis. The information on sociodemographic background, cancer treatment history, and anthropometric indices was also collected. Results: Seventy-two subjects considered diet as a contributing factor to breast cancer, and 67 subjects changed their dietary habits after breast cancer diagnosis. The reasons for changes in diet were physician and dietitian advice and desire to cure cancer. The sources of information were derived from their physician, mass media, and family members. Total energy, protein, total fat, fatty acids, and vitamin E intake were significantly decreased after diagnosis. Meanwhile, the intake of β-carotene and vitamin C increased significantly after diagnosis. The changes included reduction in red meat, seafood, noodles, and poultry intake. An increased consumption of fruits, vegetables, fish, low-fat milk, and soy products was observed. The subjects tended to lower high-fat foods intake and started to eat more fruits and vegetables. Conclusion: Breast cancer patients had changed to a healthier diet after breast cancer diagnosis, although the changes made were small. Implications for Practice: This will be helpful to dietitians in providing a better understanding of good eating habits that will maintain patients' health after breast cancer diagnosis.

abstract={Objective: Treatment delays in breast cancer are generally thought to affect prognosis but the impact on survival remains unclear. Indicators for breast cancer care include time to primary treatment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether time to primary treatment (TPT) in breast cancer impacts survival. Method: A total of 648 breast cancer patients treated in the University Malaya Medical Center (UMMC), Malaysia between 2004 and 2005 were included in the study. TPT was calculated from the date of pathological diagnosis to the date of primary treatment. Mortality data was obtained from the National Registry of Births and Deaths. Last date of follow-up was November 2010. Results: Median TPT was 18. days. Majority 508 (69.1%) of the patients received treatment within 30. days after diagnosis. The majority was surgically treated. Ethnicity (p = 0.002) and stage at presentation (p = 0.007) were significantly associated with delayed TPT. Malay ethnicity had delayed TPT compared to the Chinese; Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.9 (Confidence Interval (CI) 1.237, 2.987). Delayed TPT did not affect overall survival on univariate and multivariate analyses. Conclusion: Time to primary treatment after a diagnosis of breast cancer had no impact on overall survival. Further studies on care before diagnosis are important in drawing up meaningful quality indicators. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The purpose of this study was to profile older breast cancer survivors in Malaysia. In a survey study, a custom made questionnaire was administered to 69 breast cancer patients and survivors between 60 and 84 years of age in Peninsular Malaysia. The main ethnic group recorded was Chinese, followed by Malay and Indian. The majority of women were married (87%) and had children (84.1%). Just over half (53.6%) had primary and secondary education, whereas 24.7% had higher education. Fifty five percent of the study participants made their own decision on treatment, 60.8% exercised at least 3 times in a week, and 56.6% sought information from specialists. Our study suggests that older breast cancer survivors are aware of theimportance of exercise in their daily lives and make attempts to be cancer free (e.g. doing exercise, recreational activity and have good relationships with friends and family).},

abstract={Background: The survival outcomes for women presenting with early breast cancer are influenced by treatment decisions. In Malaysia, survival outcome is generally poor due to late presentation. Of those who present early, many refuse treatment for complementary therapy. Objective: This study aimed to explore the decision making experiences of women with early breast cancer. Materials and Methods: A qualitative study using individual in-depth interviews was conducted to capture the decision making process of women with early breast cancer in Malaysia. We used purposive sampling to recruit women yet to undergo surgical treatment. A total of eight participants consented and were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide. These women were recruited from a period of one week after they were informed of their diagnoses. A topic guide, based on the Ottawa decision support framework (ODSF), was used to facilitate the interviews, which were audio recorded, transcribed and analysed using a thematic approach. Results: We identified four phases in the decision-making process of women with early breast cancer: discovery (pre-diagnosis); confirmatory ('receiving bad news'); Deliberation; and decision (making a decision). These phases ranged from when women first discovered abnormalities in their breasts to them making final surgical treatment decisions. Information was vital in guiding these women. Support from family members, friends, healthcare professionals as well as survivors also has an influencing role. However, the final say on treatment decision was from themselves. Conclusions: The treatment decision for women with early breast cancer in Malaysia is a result of information they gather on their decision making journey. This journey starts with diagnosis. The women's spouses, friends, family members and healthcare professionals play different roles as information providers and supporters at different stages of treatment decisions. However, the final treatment decision is influenced mainly by women's own experiences, knowledge and understanding.},

abstract={Breast cancer is the most common cancer among Malaysian women. Other than hospital-based results, there are no documented population-based survival rates of Malaysian women for breast cancers. This population-based retrospective cohort study was therefore conducted. Data were obtained from Health Informatics Centre, Ministry of Health Malaysia, National Cancer Registry and National Registration Department for the period from 1st January 2000 to 31st December 2005. Cases were captured by ICD-10 and linked to death certificates to identify the status. Only complete data were analysed. Survival time was calculated from the estimated date of diagnosis to the date of death or date of loss to follow-up. Observed survival rates were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method using SPSS Statistical Software version 17. A total of 10,230 complete data sets were analysed. The mean age at diagnosis was 50.6 years old. The overall 5-year survival rate was 49% with median survival time of 68.1 months. Indian women had a higher survival rate of 54% compared to Chinese women (49%) and Malays (45%). The overall 5-year survival rate of breast cancer patient among Malaysian women was still low for the cohort of 2000 to 2005 as compared to survival rates in developed nations. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the strategies for early detection and intervention.},

abstract={Objectives: Accurate medical information is essential among health care professionals to aid dissemination of information to the public. This study aimed to determine the level of knowledge about breast cancer and to identify related factors among undergraduate health sciences students in a public university in Terengganu, Malaysia. Methods: The respondents included students aged 18 years old or older who were enrolled in nursing, medical laboratory technician (MLT) and radiography diploma programmes. A Breast Cancer and Chemotherapy Questionnaire (BCCQ) was administered; higher scores on it indicated better knowledge. The reliability and validity of the BCCQ was considered adequate. Descriptive statistics, independent t test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple logistic regressions were employed (SPSS 16). Results: A total of 239 respondents participated (mean age = 19.8 ± 0.1 years; females = 83.7%). The knowledge level was moderate. Females, nursing, and final-year students possessed significantly better knowledge. After adjusting for covariates, significant factors determining good breast cancer knowledge include being in the nursing discipline and years of study. Conclusion: This study has generally ascertained that knowledge related to breast cancer and chemotherapy among this sample population remains moderate and is not uniformly disseminated. An increase in knowledge is required to ensure an optimal level of knowledge, particularly for the junior students and those from courses other than nursing. © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2013.},

abstract={Background: Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death among women in Malaysia. A diagnosis is very stressful for women, affecting all aspects of their being and quality of life. As such, there is little information on quality of life of women with breast cancer across the different ethnic groups in Malaysia. The purpose of this study was to examine thequality of life in Malay and Chinese women newly diagnosed with breast cancer in Kelantan. Materials and Methods: A descriptive study involved 58 Malays and 15 Chinese women newly diagnosed with breast cancer prior to treatment. Quality of life was measured using the Malay version of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTCQLQ-C30) and its breast-specific module (QLQ-BR23). Socio-demographic and clinical data were also collected.All the data were analyzed using SPSS version 20.0. Results: Most of thewomen were married with at least a secondary education and were in late stages of breast cancer. The Malay women had lower incomes (p=0.046)and more children (p=0.001) when compared to theChinese women. Generally, both the Malay and Chinese women had good functioning quality-of-life scores [mean score range: 60.3-84.8 (Malays); 65.0-91.1 (Chinese)]and global quality of life[mean score 60.3, SD 22.2 (Malays); mean score 65.0, SD 26.6 (Chinese)]. The Malay women experienced more symptoms such as nausea and vomiting (p=0.002), dyspnoea (p=0.004), constipation (p<0.001) and breast-specific symptoms (p=0.041) when compared to the Chinese. Conclusions: Quality of life was satisfactory in both Malays and Chinese women newly diagnosed with breast cancer in Kelantan. However,Malay women had a lower quality of life due to high general as well as breast-specific symptoms. This study finding underlined the importance of measuring quality of life in the newly diagnosed breast cancer patient,as it will provide a broader picture on how a cancer diagnosis impacts multi-ethnic patients. Once health care professionals understandthis, they might then be able to determine how to best support and i prove the quality of lifeof these women during the difficult times of their disease and on-going cancer treatments.},

abstract={Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women globally. This study was conducted to compare the awareness of breast cancer and the practice of breast self-examination (BSE), clinical breast examination (CBE) and mammography screening among rural females in Pahang and Perak. A cross-sectional study was carried out in five selected rural districts of Pahang and Perak. Two hundred and fifty households were randomly selected and interviewed face to face using a semi-structured questionnaire. The majority of residents from both states were Malay, aged between 50 and 60 years and had a secondary level of education. Malay women aged 40-49 years and women with a higher level of education were significantly more aware of breast cancer (p < 0.05). About half of these women practiced BSE (60.7%) and CBE (56.1%), and 7% had underwent mammography screening. The results of this study suggest that women in Pahang and Perak have good awareness of breast cancer and that more than half practice BSE and CBE. The women's level of education appears to contribute to their level of knowledge and health behaviour. However, more effort is needed to encourage all women in rural areas to acquire further knowledge on breast cancer.},

abstract={Introduction: Cancer pain is a complex experience and is one of the most common and distressing symptom of breast cancer which affects patients' functioning in daily activities, their quality of life (QOL), and mood. Yet, there is a great lack of data on breast cancer and pain in Malaysia. Methods: A cross-sectional study using the Breast Cancer Patient Version of Quality of Life (QOL) Instrument (translated into Malay) and Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) were conducted on 87 female breast cancer patients to investigate the impact of pain interference level on their quality of life and depressive level. Results: The patients were divided into 4 groups based on their rating of how pain and aches have been a problem to them (i.e not a problem [n=18 (20.7%)], mild[n=29 (33.3%)], moderate [n=18 (20.7%)] and severe [n=22(25.3%). Pain and aches ware reported to be the most severe interference problems in QOL physical domain by patients (mean=5.8, SD=2.8), followed by fatigue (mean=6.0, SD=3.1) and sleep changes (mean=6.2, SD=3.5). Patients who reported that pain and aches had severely affected them showed significantly lower score on many aspects of quality of life (Fs > 5, p < 0.005; p < 0.0001) and patients reported pain was not a problem at all demonstrated highest score on all aspects of QOL. Patients with most severe pain interference level showed highest depressive score [F (3, 84) =3, p < 0.05]. Conclusion: The study underscores the impact of pain interference on patients' quality of life and depressive level. The pain assessment deserves significant attention and therefore a comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment of pain to rule out any related underlying issues is warranted in the management of breast cancer to ensure appropriate intervention given to the patients.},

abstract={Background: Body image dissatisfaction among breast cancer survivors has been associated with psychological stress resultant from breast cancer and resultant surgery. This study aimed to examine the psychometric properties of the Malay Version of the Breast-Impact of Treatment Scale (MVBITS) and to investigate the associations of retained factors with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES). Materials and Methods: The MVBITS was 'forward-backward' translated from English to Malay and then administered to 70 female breast cancer patients who came to the Oncology Clinic of University Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to undergo chemotherapy. Principal component analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation was performed to explore the factor structure of the MVBITS. Associations of retained factors were estimated with reference to Spearman correlation coefficients. Results: The internal consistency reliability of MVBITS was good (Cronbach's alpha 0.945) and showed temporal stability over a 3-week period. Principal component analysis suggested two factors termed as 'Intrusion' and 'Avoidance' domains. These factors explained 70.3% of the variance. Factor 1 comprised the effects of breast cancer treatment on the emotion and thought, while Factor 2 informed attempts to limit exposure of the body to self or others. The Factor 1 of MVBITS was positively correlated with total, depression and anxiety sub-scores of HADS. Factor 2 was positively correlated with total and anxiety sub-scores of HADS. MVBITS was also positively correlated with the RSES scores. Conclusions: The results showed that the Malay Version of Breast-Impact of Treatment Scale possesses satisfactory psychometric properties suggesting that this instrument is appropriate for assessment of body change stress among female breast cancer patients in Malaysia.},

abstract={Background: The psychological stress after diagnosis of breast cancer is often severe. Most of the women with breast cancer and their families suffer from emotional, social, financial and psychological disturbances. Materials and Methods: A cluster non-randomized trial was conducted at a Cancer Society in Melaka, Malaysia to assess the effectiveness of psycho-education on well-being status and depression among breast cancer patients. The study period was for one month (11th June 2011 and 16th July 2011). Participants in this study were 34 adult women suffering from non-metastatic breast cancer and on appropriate allopathic medication. The WHO-five Well-being Index (1998 version) was used as the screening instrument for the assessment of well-being and depression. The data collected were tabulated and analyzed by using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 11.0. Wilcoxon Signed-rank Test was applied for comparison between pre-test and post-test scores. A P value &lt;0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: This study revealed that majority of the participants was in the state of adequate well-being after the psycho-education 33 (97.1%). The proportion of depressed individuals had also reduced from 8 (23.5%) to 1 (2.9%) after the psychological intervention. The post-test results significantly improved after the intervention for the items related to "I have felt calm and relaxed", "I woke up feeling fresh and rested" and "my daily life has been filled with things that interest me" along with the "overall impression" in the WHO-5 Well-being Index. Conclusion: Group psycho-education played a significant role in improving the well-being status and reducing depression of breast cancer survivors.

abstract={Delay in seeking treatment for breast cancer is a barrier to the early diagnosis and management of the disease, resulting in a poorer prognosis. We here estimated the prevalence of delayed presentation for breast cancer and identified possible influential sociodemographic factors in a cross-sectional study of 250 patients diagnosed with primary breast cancer at the Radiotherapy and Oncology Clinic in Kuala Lumpur Hospital. Data were collected by face-to-face interview using a structured questionnaire and from medical records. We examined associations between delayed presentation (presenting to a physician more than 3 months after self-discovery of a symptom) and sociodemographic characteristics, practice of breast self examination (BSE), history of benign breast disease, family history of breast cancer and type of symptom, symptom disclosure and advice from others to seek treatment using multiple logistic regression. Time from self-discovery of symptom to presentation ranged from tghe same day to 5 years. Prevalence of delayed presentation was 33.1% (95%CI: 27.4, 39.3). A significantly higher proportion of delayers presented with late stages (stage III/IV) (58.3% vs. 26.9%, p<0.001). Divorced or widowed women (OR: 2.23, 95% CI: 1.11, 4.47) had a higher risk of delayed presentation than married women and women who never performed breast self examination were more likely to delay presentation compared to those who regularly performed BSE (OR: 2.74, 95% CI: 1.33, 5.64). Our findings indicate that delayed presentation for breast cancer symptoms among Malaysian women is high and that marital status and breast self examination play major roles in treatment-seeking for breast cancer symptoms.},

abstract={We determined the incidences of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) subtypes among breast cancer cases in Sarawak, Malaysia and their correlation with various risk factors in the three ethnic groups: Chinese, Malay and native. Subtype status was ascertained for 1,034 cases of female breast cancer (93% of all cases diagnosed since 2003), and the age-standardized incidence rates (ASRs) of each subtype were inferred. Case-case comparisons across subtypes were performed for reproductive risk factors. We found 48% luminal A (ER+/PR+/HER2-), 29% triple-negative (ER-/PR-/HER2-), 12% triple-positive (ER+/PR+/HER2+) and 11% HER2-overexpressing (ER-/PR-/HER2+) subtypes, with ASRs of 10.6, 6.0, 2.8 and 2.8 per 100,000, respectively. The proportions of subtypes and ASRs differed significantly by ethnic groups: HER2-positive cases were more frequent in Malays (29%; 95% CI [23;35]) than Chinese (22%; [19;26] and natives (21%; [16;26]); triple-negative cases were less frequent among Chinese (23%; [20;27]) than Malays (33%; [27;39]) and natives (37%; [31;43]). The results of the case-case comparison were in accordance with those observed in western case series. Some uncommon associations, such as between triple-negative subtype and older age at menopause (OR, 1.59; p < 0.05), were found. The triple-negative and HER2+ subtypes predominate in our region, with significant differences among ethnic groups. Our results support the idea that the risk factors for different subtypes vary markedly. Westernized populations are more likely to have factors that increase the risk for the luminal A type, while risk factors for the triple-negative type are more frequent in local populations.

abstract={Introduction: Nutritional decline is typically accepted as a consequent of the course of treatment for cancer. This study aimed to (1) assess body weight status and dietary intake of breast cancer patientson chemotherapy and (2) to correlate Body Mass Index (BMI), energy and protein intake with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) profile. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in twogovernment hospitals in the East coast of Peninsular Malaysia using convenience sampling. Women aged >18 years, who were diagnosed with breast cancer and receiving chemotherapy were invited to participate. The following aspects were evaluated: body weight status, usual dietary intake (diet history) and HRQoL (EORTC QLQ-C30). Descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests were employed (SPSS 16). Results: Of the respondents, 41 were 49 ± 9.6 years of age; 92.7% were Malay; 97.6% (response rate = 91%) were on moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. Over half of the patients were overweight or obese (mean BMI = 25.3 ± 1.1 kg/m2). The majority self-reported weight reduction (46.3%) but positive energy balance was detected with the current energy and protein intakes recorded at 1792.6 ± 304.9kcal/day (range= 1200-2500) and 74.5g/day (IqR= 37.7)respectively. Dietary intakes were, however, not correlated with HRQoL, but greater BMI was associated with better emotional and cognitive functioning and less fatigue. Conclusion: Although most patients declared losing weight, obesity and excess dietary intake were noted. Additionally, body weight status has been shown to be important in HRQoL profile, underlining the necessity for effective nutritional assessments and support to the cancer population.},

abstract={Angiogenesis is essential for tumour growth and metastasis, and constitutes an important process in the control of cancer progression. The use of anti-angiogenic agents, particularly those targeting vascular endothelial growth factor, has become an integral component of anticancer regimens for many tumour types. Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor, is one of the most extensively studied targeted agents and has demonstrated significant clinical benefits in several solid tumours, including breast cancer. In metastatic breast cancer, randomised phase III trials have consistently demonstrated that bevacizumab, when combined with standard first-line chemotherapy regimens, significantly improved response rate and progression-free survival compared with chemotherapy alone. A recent phase III trial has also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival with the addition of bevacizumab to second-line chemotherapy regimens in patients with previously treated metastatic breast cancer. Bevacizumab is generally well tolerated, with a limited impact on chemotherapy toxicity. Typical adverse events include hypertension, proteinuria, bleeding, and thromboembolic events, which are usually manageable. The use of bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel as first-line therapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor-2-negative metastatic breast cancer has been approved in more than 80 countries worldwide, including Hong Kong, Australia, the European Union, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Switzerland, and Taiwan. This article summarises current data pertaining to the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab when combined with chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer from phase III studies and large-scale meta-analyses. © 2012 Hong Kong College of Radiologists.},

abstract={Introduction: Given that breast cancers in germline BRCA1 carriers are predominantly estrogen-negative and triple-negative, it has been suggested that women diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) younger than 50 years should be offered BRCA1 testing, regardless of family cancer characteristics. However, the predictive value of triple-negative breast cancer, when taken in the context of personal and family cancer characteristics, is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine whether TNBC is a predictor of germline BRCA1 mutations, in the context of multiple predictive factors.Methods: Germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 were analyzed by Sanger sequencing and multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis in 431 women from the Malaysian Breast Cancer Genetic Study, including 110 women with TNBC. Logistic regression was used to identify and to estimate the predictive strength of major determinants. Estrogen receptor (ER) and phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) status were assessed and included in a modified Manchester scoring method.Results: Our study in an Asian series of TNBC patients demonstrated that 27 (24.5%) of 110 patients have germline mutations in BRCA1 (23 of 110) and BRCA2 (four of 110). We found that among women diagnosed with breast cancer aged 36 to 50 years but with no family history of breast or ovarian cancer, the prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations was similar in TNBC (8.5%) and non-TNBC patients (6.7%). By contrast, in women diagnosed with breast cancer, younger than 35 years, with no family history of these cancers, and in women with a family history of breast cancer, the prevalence of mutations was higher in TNBC compared with non-TNBC (28.0% and 9.9%; P = 0.045; and 42.1% and 14.2%; P < 0.0001, respectively]. Finally, we found that incorporation of estrogen-receptor and TNBC status improves the sensitivity of the Manchester Scoring method (42.9% to 64.3%), and furthermore, incorporation of PTEN status further improves sensitivity (42.9% to 85.7%).Conclusions: We found that TNBC is an important criterion for highlighting women who may benefit from genetic testing, but that this may be most useful for women with early-onset breast cancer (35 years or younger) or with a family history of cancers. Furthermore, addition of TNBC and PTEN status improves the sensitivity of the Manchester scoring method and may be particularly important in the Asian context, where risk-assessment models underestimate the number of mutation carriers. © 2012 Phuah et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous subgroup of breast cancer characterized by the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expressions. This subgroup of refractory disease tends to have aggressive clinical behavior, high frequency of metastasis and lack of response to current hormonal or targeted therapies. Despite numerous studies reporting the clinicopathological features of TNBC and its association with the basal-like phenotype in the Western population, only limited data are available in the Asian population. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the clinicopathological characteristics of TNBC and its association with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), cytokeratin 5/6 (CK5/6) and mast/stem cell growth factor receptor (c-KIT or CD117) expression in Malaysian women. Methods. A total of 340 patients diagnosed with primary breast cancer between 2002 and 2006 in Malaysia were reviewed and analyzed. Results: The incidence of TNBC was 12.4% (42/340). Bivariate analysis revealed that TNBC was strongly associated with a younger age, higher grade tumor and p53 expression. Further immunohistochemical analysis suggested that TNBC in Malaysian women was strongly associated with EGFR, CK5/6 and c-KIT expression with high a Ki-67 proliferation index. Conclusion: In conclusion, our study confirms the association of TNBC with basal-like marker expression (EGFR, CK5/6 and c-KIT) in Malaysian women, consistent with studies in other populations. © 2012 Kanapathy Pillai et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Introduction: Lymph node ratio (LNR, i.e. the ratio of the number of positive nodes to the total number of nodes excised) is reported to be superior to the absolute number of nodes involved (pN stage) in classifying patients at high versus low risk of death following breast cancer. The added prognostic value of LNR over pN in addition to other prognostic factors has never been assessed. Methods: All patients diagnosed with lymph node positive, non-metastatic invasive breast cancer at the National University Hospital (Singapore) and University of Malaya Medical Center (Kuala Lumpur) between 1990-2007 were included (n = 1589). Overall survival of the patients was estimated by the Kaplan Meier method for LNR [categorized as low (>0 and <0.2), intermediate (0.2-0.65) and high (>0.65-1)] and pN staging [pN1, pN2 and pN3]. Adjusted overall relative mortality risks associated with LNR and pN were calculated by Cox regression. The added prognostic value of LNR over pN was evaluated by comparing the discriminating capacity (as indicated by the c statistic) of two multivariate models, one including pN and one including LNR. Results: LNR was superior to pN in categorizing mortality risks for women ≥60 years, those with ER negative or grade 3 tumors. In combination with other factors (i.e. age, treatment, grade, tumor size and receptor status), substituting pN by LNR did not result in better discrimination of women at high versus low risk of death, neither for the entire cohort (c statistic 0.72 [0.70-0.75] and 0.73 [0.71-0.76] respectively for pN versus LNR), nor for the subgroups mentioned above. Conclusion: In combination with other prognosticators, substitution of pN by LNR did not provide any added prognostic value for South East Asian breast cancer patients. © 2012 Saxena et al.},

abstract={It is well known that the endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) dibutylphthalate (DBP) inhibits testosterone synthesis and can lead to feminisation in male laboratory animals. Moreover, it has long been speculated that human exposure would result in the similar effects, but this is difficult to study because specific human exposure cohorts are rare. We report increases in the incidences of hypospadias (p <0.05), cryptorchidism (p<0.05) and breast cancer (p<0.05) in the children of New Zealand soldiers who served in Malaya (1948- 1960) and were exposed to DBP applied daily to their clothing as an acaricide to prevent ticktransmitted bush typhus. In addition, we modelled absorption of DBP from the soldiers' clothing and using published data for skin absorption, and calculated a large theoretical absorbed dose of 64 mg/kg body weight/day which is similar to DBP's lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) of 50 mg/kg body weight/day and thus indicates a biological effect is possible. This is the first report of a multigenerational developmental effect following DBP exposure in human males. © NZMA.},

abstract={The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the association between TCF7L2 rs12255372(G/T) or rs7903146(C/T) polymorphism and breast cancer risk, and clinico-pathologic characteristics of the patients. Genotyping of these polymorphisms was performed on 387 breast cancer patients and 252 normal and healthy women who had no history of any malignancy using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method in a hospital-based Malaysian population. The allele (P = 0.033) frequency of rs7903146 (T) polymorphism was significantly higher in the cancer patients than normal individuals. No significant association was demonstrated between CT (ORadj = 1.386; 95% CI, 0.985-1.949) or TT (ORadj = 1.579; 95% CI, 0.869-2.870) genotype and breast cancer risk. However, women who were carriers of T allele (ORadj = 1.316; 95% CI, 1.022-1.695) or T allele genotype (ORadj = 1.419; 95% CI, 1.027-1.960) showed significant increased risk of breast cancer. Women who were GT heterozygotes (OR adj = 1.329; 95% CI, 0.948-1.862) or TT homozygotes (ORadj = 1.574; 95% CI, 0.829-2.987), and carriers of T allele genotype (OR adj = 1.365; 95% CI, 0.989-1.883) or T allele (ORadj = 1.284; 95% CI, 0.995-1.657) were not associated with breast cancer risk. The rs7903146(T) allele genotype was significantly associated with nodal involvement (P = 0.003) but rs12255372 (T) allele genotype was not associated with the clinico-pathologic characteristics. In conclusion, our findings suggest that rs7903146 (T) variant may elevate the risk of breast cancer, thus could be a potential candidate for breast cancer susceptibility. The variant may also increase the metastatic potential of the tumor. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.},

abstract={Background: Adjuvant! Online is a free web-based tool which predicts 10-year breast cancer outcomes and the efficacy of adjuvant therapy in patients with breast cancer. As its prognostic performance has only been validated in high income Caucasian populations, we validated the model in a middle income Asian setting. Methods: Within the University Malaya Hospital-Based Breast Cancer Registry, all 631 women who were surgically treated for invasive non-metastatic breast cancer between 1993 and 2000 were identified. The discriminative performance of Adjuvant! Online was tested using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Calibration of the model was evaluated by comparing predicted 10-year overall survival with observed 10-year survival. Findings: Adjuvant! Online was fairly capable in discriminating between good and poor survivors, as attested by the area under ROC curve of 0.73 (95% Confidence Interval: 0.69-0.77). Overall, Adjuvant! Online predicted 10 year survival (70.3%) was significantly higher than the observed 10 year survival (63.6%, difference of 6.7%; 95% CI: 3.0-10.4%). The model was especially overoptimistic in women under 40 years and in women of Malay ethnicity, where survival was overestimated by approximately 20% (95% CI: 9.8-29.8%) and 15% (95% CI: 5.3-24.5%) respectively. Interpretation: Even though Adjuvant! Online is capable of discriminating between good and poor survivors, it systematically overestimates survival. These findings suggest that the model requires adaptation prior to use in Asian settings. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Introduction: Germline TP53 mutations cause an increased risk to early-onset breast cancer in Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) families and the majority of carriers identified through breast cancer cohorts have LFS or Li-Fraumeni-like (LFL) features. However, in Asia and in many low resource settings, it is challenging to obtain accurate family history and we, therefore, sought to determine whether the presence of early-onset breast cancer is an appropriate selection criteria for germline TP53 testing.Methods: A total of 100 patients with early-onset breast cancer (≤ 35 years) treated at University Malaya Medical Centre between 2003 and 2009, were analyzed for germline mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53 by full DNA sequencing. Of the mutations identified, we examined their likely pathogenicity on the basis of prevalence in a case-control cohort, co-segregation analyses and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in tumor tissues.Results: We identified 11 BRCA1 (11%) and 6 BRCA2 (6%) germline carriers among early-onset breast cancer patients. Of the 83 BRCA-negative patients, we identified four exonic variants and three intronic variants in TP53. Of these, two exonic variants are clinically relevant (E346X and p. G334_R335dup6) and two novel missense mutations (A138V and E285K) are likely to be clinically relevant, on the basis of co-segregation and loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Notably, E285K was found in two unrelated individuals and haplotype analyses suggest a founder effect. Two of the three intronic variants are likely benign based on their prevalence in a control population. Clinically relevant TP53 germline mutations were identified in three of the four patients (75%) with a family history of at least two LFS-linked cancers (breast, bone or soft tissue sarcoma, brain tumors or adrenocortical cancer); 1 of the 17 patients (6%) with a family history of breast cancer only, and 1 of the 62 patients (< 2%) with no family history of breast or LFS-linked cancers.Conclusions: Our study reports germline BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53 mutations are found in early-onset breast cancer patients at 11%, 6% and 5% respectively, suggesting that TP53 mutation screening should be considered for these patients. However, we find that even in low resource Asian settings where family history is poorly reported, germline TP53 mutations are found predominantly among breast cancer patients with a family history of LFS-linked cancers. © 2012 Lee et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Chronic granulomatous mastitis is known as a benign and relatively rare disorder that is often difficult to differentiate from breast carcinoma. We highlight the case of a 34-year-old woman who had recurrent episodes of right breast swelling and abscess for 8 years. These were proven to be chronic granulomatous mastitis by tissue biopsies on 3 different occasions. Her condition improved on similar courses of antibiotics and high-dose prednisolone. However, she subsequently developed progressive loss of vision due to an orbital tumour. She then underwent a craniotomy and left orbital decompression with excision of the tumour, which proved to be a metastatic carcinoma. A trucut biopsy of the right breast was then done and showed features consistent with an infiltrating ductal carcinoma. This case illustrates the possibility that chronic granulomatous mastitis could be a precursor for malignancy and the difficulty in differentiating one from the other. The possible mechanisms of development and the implications for future management are also discussed. © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2012.},

abstract={Introduction: Distress thermometer (DT) is a single-item measure generated to assess the psychological distress among cancer patients. The aim of this study was to validate the translated DT as a tool to determine the psychological distress level and assess the factors associated with distress among the working breast cancer survivors and also to compare with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Methods: 150 working breast cancer survivors were interviewed using the Malay and Chinese language translated version of DT and HADS. Results: Based on HADS, 23.3% were anxious, 19.3% were depressed whereas 15.3% experienced both anxiety and depression. About 14.7% of the respondents reported distress (cutoff ≥ 5) on DT. A significant association was found between the DT and HADS which indicated that both were measuring the same construct, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-T (F= 71.34, p< 0.001), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-A (F= 65.81, p< 0.001), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-D (F= 74.28, p< 0.001). This study also showed that a cut-off of ≥5 on DT yielded an area under Receiver analysis characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.95 with a sensitivity of 90.9% and specificity of 89.8% for HADS-T score defined as cases. On the problem checklist, respondents scoring above the cut-off of 5 on DT had a greater number of problems with family (70.0%), emotional (65.0%), physical (60.0%), practical (50.0%) and spiritual/religious (15.0%) issues. Discussion: Overall, DT was a useful and simple screening tool to indicate psychological distress.

abstract={Objective: Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths in women both worldwide and in Malaysia. Azadirachta indica (A. Juss), commonly known as neem, is one of the most versatile medicinal plants that has gained worldwide prominence due to its medicinal properties. However, the anticancer effect of ethanolic neem leaf extract against breast cancer has not been documented. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the effect of neem leaf extract on c-Myc oncogene expression in 4T1 breast cancer BALB/c mice. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, A total of 48 female BALB/c mice were divided randomly into four groups of 12 mice per group: i.cancer control (CC) treated with 0.5% Tween 20 in PBS, ii. 0.5 μg/mL tamoxifen citrate (CT), iii. 250 mg/kg neem leaf extract (C250), and iv. 500 mg/kg neem leaf extract (C500). In situ reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (in situ RT-PCR) was applied to evaluate suppression of c-Myc oncogene expression in breast cancer tissue. Results: The C500 group showed significant (p<0.05) suppression of c-Myc oncogene expression compared to the CC group. Conclusion: c-Myc was found to be down regulated under the effect of 500 mg/kg ethanolic neem leaf extract.},

abstract={Background: The burden of breast cancer in Asia is escalating. We evaluated the impact of ethnicity on survival after breast cancer in the multi-ethnic region of South East Asia. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using the Singapore-Malaysia hospital-based breast cancer registry, we analyzed the association between ethnicity and mortality following breast cancer in 5,264 patients diagnosed between 1990 and 2007 (Chinese: 71.6%, Malay: 18.4%, Indian: 10.0%). We compared survival rates between ethnic groups and calculated adjusted hazard ratios (HR) to estimate the independent effect of ethnicity on survival. Malays (n = 968) presented at a significantly younger age, with larger tumors, and at later stages than the Chinese and Indians. Malays were also more likely to have axillary lymph node metastasis at similar tumor sizes and to have hormone receptor negative and poorly differentiated tumors. Five year overall survival was highest in the Chinese women (75.8%; 95%CI: 74.4%-77.3%) followed by Indians (68.0%; 95%CI: 63.8%-72.2%), and Malays (58.5%; 95%CI: 55.2%-61.7%). Compared to the Chinese, Malay ethnicity was associated with significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR: 1.34; 95%CI: 1.19-1.51), independent of age, stage, tumor characteristics and treatment. Indian ethnicity was not significantly associated with risk of mortality after breast cancer compared to the Chinese (HR: 1.14; 95%CI: 0.98-1.34). Conclusion: In South East Asia, Malay ethnicity is independently associated with poorer survival after breast cancer. Research into underlying reasons, potentially including variations in tumor biology, psychosocial factors, treatment responsiveness and lifestyle after diagnosis, is warranted. © 2012 Bhoo-Pathy et al.},

abstract={Background: We investigated the implications of HER2 amplification in Asian women with small, node-negative breast cancer in low- and middle-income countries (LMCs). Methods: We reviewed the charts patients treated between 1989 and 2009 with breast conservation therapy for node-negative breast cancers measuring ≤2 cm. Disease-free survival (DFS), ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR), distant disease-free survival (DDFS), and overall survival (OS) rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and were compared by the log-rank test. Potential covariates-age, tumor grade, hormone receptor status-were analyzed by multivariate analysis. Results: A total of 519 patients were studied including 204 (39%) and 315 (61%) patients diagnosed with pT1ab and pT1c tumors, respectively. Median follow-up was 57 months. HER2 amplification was found in 17.1% of all patients and in 16.7% patients with pT1ab tumors. Among patients with T1ab tumors, 73.0 and 9.3% underwent adjuvant hormonal and chemotherapy, respectively; 3 of 34 T1ab patients with HER2-amplified tumors received trastuzumab. HER2 amplification was associated with poorer 5-year DFS (83.7% vs. 95.5%, P < 0.0001), DDFS (87.5% vs. 97.9%, P < 0.0001), and IBTR (8.6% vs. 2.1%, P < 0.0001) rates in patients with pT1 tumors. Multivariate analysis showed that HER2 amplification remained a significant negative prognostic factor for DFS [hazard ratio (HR) 4.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1-7.8, P < 0.0001], DDFS (HR 6.3, 95% CI 2.4-17.0, P < 0.0001), and IBTR (HR 4.5, 95% CI 2.0-10.0, P < 0.0001) rates. In the pT1ab subgroup, univariate analysis showed that HER2 amplification prognosticated for DFS (85.1% vs. 95.7%, P = 0.022) and IBTR (14.9% vs. 3.5%, P = 0.004) rates but not for the OS (100% vs. 99.2%, P = 0.487) rate. Similar results were obtained after excluding patients given trastuzumab. Conclusions: The decision to use trastuzumab in HER2-amplified pT1ab tumors must balance their poor outcome against intrinsic financial limitations in LMCs. Patient selection criteria needs fine-tuning, and resource-sensitive regimens must be explored. © 2011 Société Internationale de Chirurgie.},

abstract={Background: Prognosis of breast cancer depends on classic pathological factors and also tumor angiogenesis. This study aimed to evaluate the clinicopathological factors of breast cancer in a tertiary centre with a focus on the relationship between tumor angiogenesis and clinicopathological factors. Methods: Clinicopathological data were retrieved from the archived formal pathology reports for surgical specimens diagnosed as invasive ductal carcinoma, NOS. Microvessels were immunohistochemically stained with anti-CD34 antibody and quantified as microvessel density. Results: At least 50% of 94 cases of invasive breast ductal carcinoma in the study were advanced stage. The majority had poor prognosis factors such as tumor size larger than 50mm (48.9%), positive lymph node metastasis (60.6%), and tumor grade III (52.1%). Higher percentages of estrogen and progesterone receptor negative cases were recorded (46.8% and 46.8% respectively). Her-2 overexpression cases and triple negative breast cancers constituted 24.5% and 22.3% respectively. Significantly higher microvessel density was observed in the younger patient age group (p=0.012). There were no significant associations between microvessel density and other clinicopathological factors (p>0.05). Conclusions: Majority of the breast cancer patients of this institution had advanced stage disease with poorer prognostic factors as compared to other local and western studies. Breast cancer in younger patients might be more proangiogenic.},

abstract={Background There are large differences in socioeconomic growth within the region of South East Asia, leading to sharp contrasts in health-systems development between countries. This study compares breast cancer presentation and outcome between patients from a high income country (Singapore) and a middle income country (Malaysia) in South East Asia. Methods Within the Singapore Malaysia Breast Cancer Registry we identified all consecutive patients diagnosed with breast cancer between 1993 and 2007 at the National University Hospital in Singapore (high income country, n = 2,141) and the University of Malaya Medical Center in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (middle income country, n = 3,320). We compared demographics, tumor characteristics, treatment patterns, and survival between patients from both countries. Results In Malaysia, patients were less often diagnosed with in situ breast cancer (adjusted odds ratio [ORadj] 0.2; 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI] 0.1-0.3), more likely to be diagnosed with late stage (III and IV) disease (ORadj for stage III 1.6; 95 % CI 1.3-2.0; ORadj for stage IV 1.2; 95 % CI 1.1-1.4) as compared to patients from Singapore. Univariate analysis showed that Malaysian patients were at a 72 % increased risk of death as compared to Singaporeans. After adjusting for other prognostic factors, the risk decreased by only 5 % (ORadj 1.67, 95 % CI 1.44-1.92). © Société Internationale de Chirurgie 2012.},

abstract={Background: The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 10398 polymorphism is hypothesised to alter a mitochondrial subunit of the electron transfer chain and is associated with several neurodegenerative disorders and cancers. Methods: In this study, an mtDNA polymorphism at nucleotide position 10398 was screened in 101 Malay female patients with invasive breast cancer and 90 age-matched healthy female controls using minisequencing analysis. Results: The Malay women with the 10398G variant showed a significantly increased risk of invasive breast cancer (OR = 2.29, 95% CI 1.25-4.20, P = 0.007). Immunohistochemistry analysis was conducted to investigate the effect of this polymorphism on the levels of apoptosis in breast cancer cells. The level of Bax (a pro-apoptotic protein) expression was significantly higher than that of Bcl-2 (an anti-apoptotic protein) in patients carrying the G allele (P = 0.016) but not in those carrying the A allele (P = 0.48). Conclusion: Based on these findings, we propose that the mtDNA 10398 polymorphism may be a potential risk marker for breast cancer susceptibility in the Malay population. © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia.},

abstract={Introduction: Worldwide, breast cancer is the commonest cause of cancer death in women. However, the survival rate varies across regions at averages of 73%and 57% in the developed and developing countries, respectively. Objective: This study aimed to determine the survival rate of breast cancer among the women of Malaysia and characteristics of the survivors. Method: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on secondary data obtained from the Breast Cancer Registry and medical records of breast cancer patients admitted to Hospital Kuala Lumpur from 2005 to 2009. Survival data were validated with National Birth and Death Registry. Statistical analysis applied logistic regression, the Cox proportional hazard model, the Kaplan-Meier method and log rank test. Results: A total of 868 women were diagnosed with breast cancer between January 2005 and December 2009, comprising 58%, 25% and 17% Malays, Chinese and Indians, respectively. The overall survival rate was 43.5% (CI 0.573-0.597), with Chinese, Indians and Malays having 5 year survival rates of 48.2% (CI 0.444-0.520), 47.2% (CI 0.432-0.512) and 39.7% (CI 0.373-0.421), respectively (p<0.05). The survival rate was lower as the stages increased, with the late stages were mostly seen among the Malays (46%), followed by Chinese (36%) and Indians (34%). Size of tumor>3.0cm; lymph node involvement, ERPR, and HER 2 status, delayed presentation and involvement of both breasts were among other factors that were associated with poor survival. Conclusions: The overall survival rate of Malaysian women with breast cancer was lower than the western figures with Malays having the lowest because they presented at late stage, after a long duration of symptoms, had larger tumor size, and had more lymph nodes affected. There is an urgent need to conduct studies on why there is delay in diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer women in Malaysia.},

abstract={Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use is prevalent among individuals with cancer, especially breast cancer survivors. This study was conducted among 394 breast cancer survivors in selected regions of Peninsular Malaysia to identify the pattern and factors associated with CAM use. About 51% of the respondents reported CAM use as complementary treatment. Vitamins (47.2%), spiritual activities (33.2%) and other dietary supplements (30.7%) were the most commonly used CAM therapies. Common reasons for CAM use were to increase the body's ability to perform daily activities (70.9%), enhance immune function (58.3%) and improve emotional well-being (31.7%). Users obtained CAM information mainly from friends and family members (62.5%), physicians (25.0%) and mass media (13.9%). Ethnicity and years of education were significantly associated with CAM use. Although no adverse effects of CAM were reported, breast cancer survivors should discuss their CAM use with health professionals to prevent potential adverse effects of these therapies.},

abstract={Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among women in Malaysia. Despite the campaigns undertaken to raise the awareness of the public regarding breast cancer, breast cancer screening rates are still low in the country. The community pharmacist, as one of the most accessible healthcare practitioners, could play a role in the provision of breast cancer health promotion services to the community. However, there are no documented data regarding the community pharmacists' involvement in breast cancer related health promotion activities. Hence, this study was conducted to examine self-reported knowledge, practice and perception of community pharmacists on provision of breast cancer health promotion services and to investigate the barriers that limit their involvement. This cross-sectional survey conducted between May to September 2010, included a sample of 35 community pharmacists working in the districts of Hulu Langat and Sepang in state of Selangor. A 22-item validated questionnaire that included both closed and Lickert scale questions was used to interview those pharmacists who gave their informed consent to participate in the study. The data was analysed using SPSS. Only 11.3% of the community pharmacists answered all the questions on the knowledge section correctly. The mean overall knowledge of the community pharmacists on risk factors of breast cancer and screening recommendations is 56%. None of the respondents was currently involved in breast cancer health promotion activities. Lack of time (80%), lack of breast cancer educational materials (77.1%) and lack of training (62.9%) were the top three mentioned barriers. Despite these barriers, 94.3% (33) of the community pharmacists agreed that they should be involved in breast cancer health promotion activities. Hence, there is need to equip community pharmacists with necessary training and knowledge to enable them to contribute their share towards prevention and screening of breast cancer.},

abstract={Objective: Many recent studies investigated the prognostic value of new biomarkers in breast cancer using data from cancer registries. Some of these studies were conducted using only patients for whom biomarker status was available (or tested). Using human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) as an example, we determined whether testing for a recently introduced biomarker was associated with the outcome of women with breast cancer. Study Design and Setting: We included 910 women with newly diagnosed breast cancer in a tertiary academic hospital in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, between 2005 and 2007. Individual 2-year absolute mortality risk was estimated using Cox regression analysis. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between the absolute mortality risk and assessment of HER2 status. Results: There was a significant inverted U-shaped association between predicted mortality risk and HER2 status determination. Compared with patients with the lowest predicted mortality risk (quintile 1), patients with highest predicted mortality risk (last quintile) were significantly less likely to be tested for HER2 status, whereas those with intermediate predicted mortality risk (quintile 3) were more likely to be tested. Conclusion: Breast cancer prognostication using only patients with available biomarker status may lead to invalid results. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Introduction: Despite health education efforts to educate women on breast cancer and breast cancer screening modalities, the incidence of breast cancer and presentation at an advanced stage are still a problem in Malaysia. Objectives: To determine factors associated with the uptake of breast cancer screening among women in the general population. Methods: This pre-intervention survey was conducted in a suburban district. All households were approached and women aged 20 to 60 years old were interviewed with pre-tested guided questionnaires. Variables collected included socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge on breast cancer and screening practice of breast cancer. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed. Results: 41.5% of a total of 381 respondents scored above average; the mean knowledge score on causes and risks factors of breast cancer was 3.41 out of 5 (SD1.609). 58.5% had ever practiced BSE with half of them performing it at regular monthly intervals. Uptake of CBE by nurses and by doctors was 40.7% and 37.3%, respectively. Mammogram uptake was 14.6%. Significant predictors of BSE were good knowledge of breast cancer (OR=2.654, 95% CI: 1.033-6.816), being married (OR=2.213, 95% CI: 1.201-4.076) and attending CBE (OR=1.729, 95% CI: 1.122-2.665). Significant predictors for CBE included being married (OR=2.161, 95% CI: 1.174-3.979), good knowledge of breast cancer (OR=2.286, 95% CI: 1.012-5.161), and social support for breast cancer screening (OR=2.312, 95% CI: 1.245-4.293). Women who had CBE were more likely to undergo mammographic screening of the breast (OR=5.744, 95% CI: 2.112-15.623), p<0.005. Conclusion: CBE attendance is a strong factor in promoting BSE and mammography, educating women on the importance of breast cancer screening and on how to conduct BSE. The currently opportunistic conduct of CBE should be extended to active calling of women for CBE.},

abstract={Objective: While the relatively common nature of female breast cancer has resulted in a high level of general awareness, male breast cancer is still comparatively unknown to the general public and to healthcare professionals. The objective of this study is to explore the perceptions and opinions about male breast cancer and male breast self-examination among male university students. Methodology: In-depth interviews were conducted among 36 male university students from the Management and Science University, Malaysia, selected by simple random sampling. The themes of the interview were: knowledge of male breast cancer and male breast self-examination, sources of knowledge and attitudes towards male BSE. The data obtained were classified into various categories and analyzed manually. Results: The majority of participants mentioned that there is a low possibility for males to get breast cancer. They also believed that the cause of breast cancer among men is due to the carcinogens from cigarettes. The majority of participants mentioned that they know about breast self-examination from the mass media and that the presence of a lump in the breast is the main symptom of breast cancer in men. The majority of participants mentioned that they encourage their family members to practice breast self-examination but considered that BSE is not important for men because they have a low probability of getting breast cancer. Conclusions: Misconceptions regarding male breast cancer and breast self-examination among men still exist among male university students. Therefore especial attention should be given to educate men about male breast cancer and male BSE.},

abstract={The ER-/PR+ breast tumor may be the result of a false ER negative result. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is a difference in patient and tumor characteristics of the ER-/PR+ phenotype in an Asian setting. A total of 2629 breast cancer patients were categorized on the basis of their age, ethnicity, tumor hormonal receptor phenotype, grade and histological type. There were 1230 (46.8%) ER+/PR+, 306 (11.6%) ER+/PR-, 122 (4.6%) ER-/PR+ and 972 (37%) ER-/PR-. ER-/PR+ tumors were 2.5 times more likely to be younger than 50 years at diagnosis (OR: 2.52; 95% CI: 1.72-3.67). Compared to ER+/PR+ tumors, the ER-/PR+ phenotype was twice more likely to be associated with grade 3 tumors (OR:2.02; 95%CI: 1.00-4.10). In contrast, compared to ER-/PR- tumors, the ER-/PR+ phenotype was 90% less likely to be associated with a grade 3 tumor (OR: 0.12; 95%CI:0.05-0.26), and more likely to have invasive lobular than invasive ductal histology (OR: 3.66; 95%CI: 1.47-9.11). These results show that the ER-/PR+ phenotype occurs in a younger age group and is associated with intermediate histopathological characteristics compared to ER+/PR+ and ER-/PR- tumors. This may imply that it is a distinct entity and not a technical artifact.},

abstract={Delay in help-seeking behaviour which is potentially preventable has a major effect on the prognosis and survival of patients with breast cancer. The objective of this study was to explore reasons for delay in seeking help among patients with breast cancer from the East Coast of peninsular Malaysia. A qualitative study using face-to-face in-depth interview was carried out involving 12 breast cancer patients who had been histo-pathologically confirmed and were symptomatic on presentation. Respondents were selected purposely based on their history of delayed consultation, diagnosis or treatment. All were of Malay ethnicity and the age range was 26-67 years. Three were in stage ll, seven in stage lll and two in stage lV. At the time of interview, all except one respondent had accepted treatment. The range of consultation time was 0.2-72.2 months with a median of 1.7 months, diagnosis time was 1.4-95.8 months(median 5.4 months)and treatment time was 0-33.3 months (median 1.2 months). The themes derived from the study were poor knowledge or awareness of breast cancer, fear of cancer consequences, beliefs in complementary alternative medicine, sanction by others, other priorities, denial of disease, attitude of wait and see and health care system weakness. Help-seeking behaviour was influenced by a complex interaction of cognitive, environmental, beliefs, culture and psycho-social factors. Breast cancer awareness and psychological counselling are recommended for all patients with breast symptoms to prevent delay in seeking clinical help.},

abstract={Background: The risk of treatment-related death (TRD) and febrile neutropaenia (FN) with adjuvant taxane-based chemotherapy for early breast cancer is unknown in Malaysia despite its widespread usage in recent years. This study aims to determine these rates in patients treated in University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC). Patients and Methods: Patients who were treated with adjuvant taxane-based chemotherapy for early breast cancer stages I, II or III from 2007-2011 in UMMC were identified from our UMMC Breast Cancer Registry. The TRD and FN rates were then determined retrospectively from medical records. TRD was defined as death occurring during or within 30 days of completing chemotherapy as a consequence of the chemotherapy treatment. FN was defined as an oral temperature &gt;38.5°C or two consecutive readings of &gt;38.0°C for 2 hours and an absolute neutrophil count &lt;0.5×109/L, or expected to fall below 0.5x109/L. Results: A total of 622 patients received adjuvant chemotherapy during this period. Of these patients 209 (33.6%) received taxane-based chemotherapy. 4 taxane-based regimens were used namely the FEC-D, TC, TAC and AC-PCX regimens. The commonest regimen employed was the FEC-D regimen accounting for 79.9% of the patients. The FN rate was 10% and there was no TRD. Conclusion: Adjuvant taxane-based chemotherapy in UMMC for early breast cancer has a FN rate of 10%. Primary prophylactic G-CSF should be considered for patients with any additional risk factor for FN.},

abstract={Background: Digital mammography is slowly replacing screen flm mammography. In digital mammography, 2 methods are available in acquiring images: digital storage phosphor plate and full-feld digital mammography. The aim of this study was to compare the image quality acquired from the 2 methods of digital mammography in the detection of breast cancer. Methods: The study took place at the National Cancer Society, Kuala Lumpur, and followed 150 asymptomatic women for the duration of 1 year. Participating women gave informed consent and were exposed to 4 views from each system. Two radiologists independently evaluated the printed images based on the image quality criteria in mammography. McNemar's test was used to compare the image quality criteria between the systems. Results: The agreement between the radiologists for the digital storage phosphor plate was K{green} = 0.551 and for full-feld digital mammography was, K{green} = 0.523. Full-feld digital mammography was signifcantly better compared with the digital storage phosphor plate in right and left mediolateral oblique views (P < 0.05) in the detection of microcalcifcations, which are early signs of breast cancer. However, both systems were comparable in all other aspects of image quality. Conclusion: Digital mammography is a useful screening tool for the detection of early breast cancer and ensures better prognosis and quality of life. © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia.},

abstract={Breast cancer is a major cause of death and is the most common type of cancer among Malaysian women, accounting for more than 30% of newly diagnosed cancer cases in this population. In 2006, the National Cancer Registry recorded 3,525 cases of female breast cancer in Peninsular Malaysia. In addition to facing uncertainties, anxieties, possible disabilities and the fear of death, some breast cancer patients must deal with increased treatment-related expenses, loss of employment and consequent loss or reduction of income. This study examined the socioeconomic impact of breast cancer on breast cancer patients in Penang, Malaysia. The study involved 60 respondents, including 20 patients undergoing treatment at private hospitals and 40 patients undergoing treatment at public hospitals. Data were collected using guided interviews, which were later quantified for further analyses. Our study showed that all of the respondents who were working prior to their diagnosis were adversely affected. The most seriously affected patients were those who had to stop working and consequently lost 100% of their incomes. Another group of patients suffered pay cuts because they had to limit their working hours or opted to work part-time. Most of the adversely affected cases were from lower income groups and were either self-employed or working in the private sector. The financial burdens resulting from extra medical and non-medical expenses and lost income caused financial difficulty for some respondents. Despite these adverse economic impacts, the respondents appeared to have coped relatively well socially.

abstract={Background: The present study aimed to evaluate the association between the E-Selectin Ser128Arg polymorphism and breast cancer risk and clinicopathological characteristics of the patients. Materials and Methods: The genotypes of 387 breast cancer patients and 252 healthy women who had no history of any malignancy were detected using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) in a hospital-based Malaysian population. Results: The frequency of the Arg allele was significantly (p = 0.030) higher in breast cancer patients than in healthy individuals. Women who were Ser/Arg heterozygotes (adjusted odds ratio (OR adj) = 1.607; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.008-2.564), and carriers of the Arg allele genotype (OR adj = 1.587; 95% CI = 1.037-2.430) or Arg allele (OR adj = 1.509; 95% CI = 1.040-2.189) showed a significantly increased risk of breast cancer. Patients who were carriers of the Arg allele genotype showed a significant association with poorly differentiated tumors (p = 0.002). Conclusion: The Ser128Arg polymorphism might confer an increased susceptibility to breast cancer and contribute to aggressive phenotypic characteristics. Copyright © 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

abstract={Aim The aim of this study was to compare the healthrelated quality of life (HRQoL) of breast cancer survivors (BCSs) with that of the general female population in a northern state of Malaysia. Subjects and methods A comparative cross-sectional study using EuroQoL-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), a standardized generic instrument, was conducted at Penang General Hospital in Malaysia. Because of its applicability across a wide range of populations as well as for patients and its economic use, the EQ-5D questionnaire was used. A convenience sample of 150 female BCSs (20 years or older) and an equal number from the general population (matched with age bracket and ethnicity) were examined. Chi-square (χ2) test and independent t-test were applied to detect differences in reported problems and overall HRQoL scores between the two groups. Results Mean EQ-5D index score was significantly lower for BCSs compared with the general comparative group (0.71±0.25 vs. 0.87±0.16, p&lt;0.001) with more problems with self-care (13.3% vs. 6.0%, p&lt;0.001), performing usual activities (21.3% vs. 9.3%, p&lt;0.001), pain or discomfort (54.0% vs. 33.3%, p&lt;0.001) as well as anxiety or depression (42.0% vs. 18.7%, p&lt;0.001). The HRQoL score remained significantly lower when comparing younger and older survivors to their age-matched peers. Conclusions This study not only shows that BCSs had poor HRQoL, but also suggests that the predominance of pain and depression might have considerably contributed to the decline in health status. Survivors' QoL may derive some benefits from interventions targeting pain management and cognitive behavioral therapy for depression. © Springer-Verlag 2011.},

abstract={A survey was administered to 400 breast cancer survivors at hospitals and support group meetings in Peninsular Malaysia to explore their level of Internet use and factors related to the Internet use by breast cancer survivors. Findings of this study indicated that about 22.5% of breast cancer survivors used Internet to get information about breast health issues. They had access to computer in their more personalized spaces such as at their home and in their workplace. Breast cancer survivors tended to use Internet to get information about cancer and treatment options especially on radiotherapy, chemotherapy, health management, treatment side effects and dietary practice. Majority of Internet users believed that information on the Internet were not useful to improve their knowledge about health care issues. Also, significant relationships exist between level of Internet use and five independent variables, including, age, education level, annual income, residence, and race/ethnicity.

abstract={Background. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between the peptidyl-propyl-cis/trans isomerase 1 (PIN1) -842(G > C) and -667(T > C) polymorphic variants and breast cancer risk among Malaysian ethnic groups namely the Malays, Chinese and Indians, as well as clinico-pathological characteristics of the patients. Patients and Methods. The polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism was used to genotype 387 breast cancer patients and 252 normal and healthy women who had no history of any malignancy. Results. The distribution of -842(G > C) and -667(T > C) genotypes and alleles frequencies between breast cancer cases and normal individuals showed lack of statistical significance among the Malays (p > 0.05), Chinese (p > 0.05) and Indians (p > 0.05), respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the Malay, Chinese and Indian women who were -842CC homozygotes (p = 0.198, 0.089, 0.620), -842GC heterozygotes (p = 0.492, 0.176, 0.377) and -842C allele carriers (P = 0.226, 0.059, 0.669), respectively, were not associated with breast cancer risk. Furthermore Malay, Chinese and Indian women who were heterozygous (p = 0.777, 0.319, 0.710) and homozygous (p = 0.864, 0.986, 0.954) for -667C allele or carriers of -667C allele (p = 0.977, 0.915, 0.880), respectively, were not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. None of the -842C and -667C allele genotypes were significantly associated with the clinico-pathological characteristics. Conclusion. Our findings suggest that the polymorphic variants of -842(G > C) and -667(T > C) genes may not appear to have an influence on breast cancer risk among Malaysian Malay, Chinese and Indian women. © 2011 Informa Healthcare.},

abstract={Introduction: Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide and in Malaysia. It has better cure rate if detected early. However, the practice of breast cancer screening in Malaysia is still low. The objective of this study is to determine the knowledge and its associated factors as well as sources of information on breast cancer and breast cancer screening among female staff in a public university in Malaysia. Materials and Methods: This was a cross sectional study conducted in 2005 involving 394 female staff including academic and non-academic staff, which was selected by cluster sampling. A self-administered questionnaire on socioeconomic characteristics and family history of breast cancer was used for data collection. Chi-square Test and Fisher's Exact Test was used for testing an association using SPSS 12.0. Results: The response rate was 84.3%. Only 50.9% had high knowledge on breast cancer and breast cancer screening and this was significantly associated with occupational status, monthly family income and educational level (p<0.05). The usual source of information was mass media (92.2%) while the most preferred source is the health team (71.4%). Conclusion: As mass media was a major source of information, all types of mass media could efficiently be utilized to disseminate knowledge by presenting specific programmes associated with breast cancer and breast cancer screening.},

abstract={Background: Globally breast cancer is one of the most common cancers and a major public health challenge to women health. Malaysia is also one of the Asian nations that is facing the dilemma breast cancer with an Age Standardised Rate (ASR) of female breast cancer among Malaysian women was 47.4 per 100,000 populations. Objectives: To evaluate the knowledge and awareness of Breast Cancer among the women of different age groups and various races in the sub-urban town of Sungai Petani, Malaysia Material and Methods: A questionnaire based cross-sectional study was conducted from 9th February to 29th March The survey of 2010. Household survey was conducted in the rural areas of Sungai Petani using a pre-validated questionnaire. The time retest reliability scale was applied and the internal consistency of the study tool was estimated on the basis of Cronbach's Alpha (α = 0.68). For the purpose of data analysis, the Statistical package for Social Sciences (SPSS13.0®) was used. Chi-square test was applied analyse the categorical data. One way ANOVA applied to make Inferences about Population Means between groups. Results: A total of n=320 women from different age groups and varying ethnicities from Sungai Petani were interviewed. Comparatively a higher participation was seen from the young 18-25 years. It is seen that Chinese female respondents comparatively have a better general knowledge towards breast cancer with mean score of 2.11±1.04. However, Malay were found to have a better knowledge towards the risk factors (4.34 ±3.07) and Indians were the best in terms of knowledge towards symptoms and screening of breast cancer (7.17±2.32). Overall, Indians were found to have the highest knowledge score among all. Majority agreed that a woman can enjoy a good quality life after receiving treatment for breast cancer and treatment for breast cancer is more helpful to young patients. Conclusion: Indians women were found to have a comparatively better knowledge toward the breast cancer. However, education level was found to be the main factor affecting the knowledge level of the respondents.},

abstract={Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, marked by extensive chromosomal aberrations. In this study, we aimed to explicate the underlying chromosomal copy number (CN) alterations and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) implicated in a cohort of Malaysian hospital-based primary breast carcinoma samples using a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array platform. The analysis was conducted by hybridizing the extracted DNA of 70 primary breast carcinomas and 37 normal peripheral blood samples to the Affymetrix 250K Sty SNP arrays. Locus-specific CN aberrations and LOH were statistically summarized using the binary segmentation algorithm and hidden Markov model. Selected genes from the SNP array analysis were also validated using quantitative real-time PCR. The merging of CN and LOH data fabricated distinctive integrated alteration profiles, which were comprised of finely demarcated minimal sites of aberrations. The most prevalent gains (≥30%) were detected at the 8q arm: 8q23.1, 8q23.3, 8q24.11, 8q24.13, 8q24.21, 8q24.22, 8q24.23 and 8q24.3, whilst the most ubiquitous losses (≥20%) were noted at the 8p12, 8p21.1, 8p21.2, 8p21.1-p21.2, 8p21.3, 8p22, 8p23.1, 8p23.1-p23.2, 8p23.3, 17p11.2, 17p12, 17p11.2-p12, 17p13.1 and 17p13.2 regions. Copy-neutral LOH was characterized as the most prevailing LOH event, in which the most frequent distributions (≥30%) were revealed at 3p21.31, 5q33.2, 12q24.12, 12q24.12-q24.13 and 14q23.1. These findings offer comprehensive genome-wide views on breast cancer genomic changes, where the most recurrent gain, loss and copy-neutral LOH events were harboured within the 8q24.21, 8p21.1 and 14q23.1 loci, respectively. This will facilitate the uncovering of true driver genes pertinent to breast cancer biology and the development of prospective therapeutics.},

abstract={The incidence of breast cancer in developing countries is rapidly on the rise, and cancers are generally detected at advanced stages when a cure is not possible. If advanced cancers could be down-staged by earlier detection, many lives can be saved. However, can a screening program be successfully implemented in these countries? A high level of compliance at every level of a screening program is essential for its success. In the absence of a high level of awareness, compounded by a fatalistic attitude to life, the necessary level compliance may not be achieved. Furthermore, in view of a relatively low incidence, many women will have to be screened to detect a breast cancer; and hence a screening program may not be cost effective. It is not clear which is the best screening test to be employed; although clinical breast examination would seem appropriate, there is currently no randomized evidence that it would lead to mortality reduction. The most reasonable approach to breast cancer control in developing countries would be to provide the minimal level of cancer care that will reduce mortality and suffering, as well as to enlighten the population about the benefits of early detection using innovative approaches. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Breast cancer is the most common cancer among Malaysian women. This study aimed to determine the reproductive for premenopausal breast cancer risk in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. A case-control study was conducted in 216 histopathologically confirmed cases of premenopausal breast cancer and 216 community-based controls that were matched by age within a 5-year period and ethnicity. The results of this study showed that premenopausal breast cancer risks were strongly related to parity, number of live births and family history of breast cancer. Premenopausal women with these known reproductive and family history risk factors should take extra measures to undergo appropriate screening method for early detection of breast cancer.},

abstract={Human angiogenin (ANG) is a potent inducer of neovascularization. In the adults it plays a role in normal tissue repair. There are indications that ANG is involved in angiogenesis in females associated with some forms of cancer, remodeling of reproductive organs after delivery and in the pathology during pregnancy. The late might have the implication of impaired development and health problems of newborns. However, precise role of ANG in these conditions is yet unknown. To reveal the roles of ANG as the biomarker of breast cancer occurrence in Malaysian female population, the expression of angiogenin in patients with primary breast carcinoma was evaluated using an immunoassay (ELISA). Our results suggest that elevated level of serum/plasma ANG is a favorable prognostic factor in primary breast carcinoma, which is consistent with its role in cancer cells growth. Surprisingly the level of ANG in health control group was found to be only about 20% of that of northland's female population. This finding suggests that special emphasis should be given to explore the origin of low angiogenin level in females of Malaysia; what might be the impact of this phenomenon on the health of women and young generation, and how such ANG deficiency could be corrected. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={As is the case in many developing nations, previous studies of breast cancer screening behavior in Malaysia have used relatively small samples that are not nationally representative, thereby limiting the generalizability of results. Therefore, this study uses nationally representative data from the Malaysia Non-Communicable Disease Surveillance-1 to investigate the role of socio-economic status on breast cancer screening behavior in Malaysia, particularly differences in screening behaviour between ethnic groups. The decisions of 816 women above age 40 in Malaysia to screen for breast cancer using mammography, clinical breast exams (CBE), and breast self-exams (BSE) are modeled using logistic regression. Results indicate that after adjusting for differences in age, education, household income, marital status, and residential location, Malay women are less likely than Chinese and Indian women to utilize mammography, but more likely to perform BSE. Education level and urban residence are positively associated with utilization of each method, but these relationships vary across ethnicity. Higher education levels are strongly related to using each screening method among Chinese women, but have no statistically significant relationship to screening among Malays. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Microinjection is a powerful tool to deliver various substances, such as nucleic acids, proteins, peptides, RNA, and synthetic molecules into mammalian cells mechanically. Through microinjection, a controlled amount of protein can be delivered into the target cells to elucidate the specific functional effects in vitro. In this study, a series of protein microinjection optimization was performed in human breast cancer cells. The presence of Maltose Binding Protein (MBP) was microscopically monitored through indirect immunofluorescence assay. The optimization experimentation gave a high success rate when MBP protein was used at the minimum concentration of 1.5 mg/ml and at the injection pressures of 50 and 70 hPa. The average success rate of injections was 49.2±4.15% and 50.8±4.6%, while the average cell survivability was 50.98±4.67% and 49.72±5.48% at 50 and 70 hPa, respectively. The optimization of the MBP concentration and injection pressures successfully allowed an efficient delivery of precise protein dosage into breast cancer cells without any adverse effect. This microinjection optimization can be a practical guideline in any downstream applications of protein functional work. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.},

abstract={In the present study, we evaluated the association between the TP53BP1 Glu353Asp and T-885G polymorphisms and breast cancer risk as well as with the clinicopathological characteristics of the patients. Genotyping of these polymorphisms was performed on 387 breast cancer patients and 252 normal and healthy women who had no history of any malignancy using PCR-RFLP method in a hospital-based Malaysian population. Breast cancer risk was not observed among women who were heterozygous (ORadj=0.887; 95% CI, 0.632-1.245) or homozygous (ORadj=1.083; 95% CI, 0.595-1.969) for Asp allele, and those carriers of Asp allele (ORadj=0.979; 95% CI, 0.771-1.243). Similarly, women who were TG heterozygotes (ORadj=1.181; 95% CI, 0.842-1.658) or GG homozygotes (ORadj=1.362; 95% CI, 0.746-2.486) and carriers of G allele (ORadj=1.147; 95% CI, 0.903-1.458) were not associated with increased risk of breast cancer. Asp allele genotype was significantly associated with ER negativity (p=0.0015) and poorly differentiated tumours (p=0.008), but G allele genotype was not associated with the clinicopathological characteristics. In conclusion, Glu353Asp and T-885G polymorphic variants might not have an influence on breast cancer risk, thus might not be potential candidates for cancer susceptibility. Glu353Asp variant might be associated with tumour aggressiveness as defined by its association with ER negativity and poorly differentiated tumours. © 2011 The Authors. APMIS © 2011 APMIS.},

abstract={The cola nut (Cola nitida) tree is native to West Africa. It has been naturalized to South America, Central America, the West Indies, Sri Lanka, and Malaysia. Related to cocoa, cola nut is the source of a stimulant, and contains the polyphenolic compounds (including catechin, epicatechin, tannins, and 'Kola red') and the methylxanthine alkaloids that also occur in coffee, cocoa, and tea. Previous study has been shown the potential anticarcinogenic effect of cola nut extract on human breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7.This study was conducted to determine their mechanism of action through the apoptotic cell approach. The effect of cola nut extract on the apoptotic cell of MCF7 cells was determined by flow cytometric analysis. MCF7 cells were treated with 60 and 80 μg/ml of cola nut extract for 24 h and subjected to FACS analysis. MCF7 cells treated with 60 μg/ml cola nut extract showed an increase of 6.55% in population of apoptotic cells with a concomitant decrease in the percentage of cells in the S and G2/M phase of cell cycle compared to DMSO-treated control cells. Similarly, MCF7 cells treated with 80 μg/ml cola nut extract showed an increase of 8.29% in population of apoptotic cells with a concomitant decrease in the percentage of cells in the S and G2/M phase of cell cycle compared to DMSO-treated control cells. This suggests that cola nut treatment induces apoptosis at 24 h. In conclusion, cola nut extract may induce apoptosis in MCF-7 cell lines. © 2011 Academic Journals.},

abstract={Predictive biomarkers such as oestrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptors and c-erbB-2 oncoprotein have become a staple in breast cancer reports in the country as they increasingly play an important role in the treatment and prognosis of women with breast cancers. This study reviews the practice of histopathology reporting of these biomarkers in a Malaysian tertiary hospital setting. Retrospective data on demographic, pathological and biomarker profi les of patients with invasive ductal carcinoma who had undergone mastectomy or lumpectomy with axillary node clearance from 2005 to 2006 were retrieved from the Department of Pathology, Penang Hospital and analysed. The prevalence of ER positivity (55.8%), PR positivity (52.5%), c-erbB-2 oncoprotein overexpression (24%) and triple negativity (ER negative, PR negative, c-erbB-2 negative) (15%) by immunohistochemistry were comparable with other studies. Notably, c-erbB-2 overexpression was equivocal (2+) in 15% of cases. Since about a quarter of equivocal (2+) cases usually show amplifi cation by FISH, a small but certain percentage of patients would miss the benefi t of anti-cerbB- 2 antibody therapy if FISH is not performed. New ASCO/CAP guidelines on the quantitation of ER and PR will probably increase the prevalence of ER/PR positivity, invariably leading to signifi cant ramifi cations on the management of patients as more patients would be deemed eligible for endocrine therapy, as well as categorisation of triple negative breast cancers. © 2007-2011 College of Pathologists, all rights reserved.},

abstract={There has been no systematic appraisal of ethnicity-based variations in breast cancer (BC) biology amongst women from developing countries. A qualitative systematic review was conducted of breast cancer size, stage, grade, histological type, extra-mammary involvement, hormone receptor status as well as patient demographics. This review includes patients from Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Mexico, the Caribbean and South America. BCin these regions present at an earlier age with large aggressive tumours. Distant metastases are frequently present at the time of diagnosis. African women have a higher frequency of triple negative tumours. Over half of Middle Eastern women have lymph node involvement at the time of diagnosis. Despite experiencing a lower incidence compared to the Ashkenazi Jewish population, Palestinian women have poorer five-year survival outcomes. The majority of women from Mexico and South America have stage two or three disease whilst over sixty percent of women from Eastern Europe have either stage one or stage two disease. The biological characteristics of BC in the Caribbean cannot be fully assessed due to a paucity of data from the region. BC amongst the developing world is characterised by an early peak age of onset with aggressive biological characteristics. Strategies that improve breast cancer awareness, address amenable risk factors and improve early detection are essential. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Background: Weight gain rather than weight loss often occurs after breast cancer diagnosis despite breast cancer survivors frequently reported making healthful lifestyle changes. This study describes the prevalence and magnitude of changes in weight before and after breast cancer diagnosis and examines lifestyle behaviors of breast cancer survivors with stable weight, weight gain or weight loss. Methods. Respondents were 368 women with breast cancer characterized by stages I, II and III. All were recruited from hospitals or breast cancer support groups and had completed conventional treatment. Current weight and height were measured while weight at cancer diagnosis and 1 year before diagnosis were self-reported. Weight change was calculated as the difference between current weight and weight a year preceding breast cancer diagnosis. A 24-hour diet recall and Global Physical Activity Questionnaire assessed dietary intake and physical activity, respectively. Differences in lifestyle behaviors among weight change groups were examined using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA). Results: Mean weight change from a year preceding diagnosis to study entry was 2.73 kg (95% CI: 1.90-3.55). Most women (63.3%) experienced weight gain rather than weight loss (36.7%) with a higher percentage (47.8%) having at least 5% weight gain (47.8%) rather than weight loss (22%), respectively. Compared to other weight change groups, women in >10% weight gain group had the lowest fruit and vegetable servings (1.58 servings/day; 95% CI: 1.36-1.82) and highest servings of dairy products (0.41 servings/day; 95% CI: 0.30-0.52). Conclusions: Weight gain was evident in this sample of women after breast cancer diagnosis. Information on magnitude of weight change after breast cancer diagnosis and lifestyle behaviors of breast cancer survivors with varying degrees of weight change could facilitate the development and targeting of effective intervention strategies to achieve healthy weight and optimal health for better survival. © 2011 Yaw et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={AIM To investigate the impact of genetic polymorphisms in CYP2D6, CYP3A5, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 on the pharmacokinetics of tamoxifen and its metabolites in Asian breast cancer patients. METHODS A total of 165 Asian breast cancer patients receiving 20mg tamoxifen daily and 228 healthy Asian subjects (Chinese, Malay and Indian; n= 76 each) were recruited. The steady-state plasma concentrations of tamoxifen and its metabolites were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography. The CYP2D6 polymorphisms were genotyped using the INFINITI™ CYP450 2D6I assay, while the polymorphisms in CYP3A5, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 were determined via direct sequencing. RESULTS The polymorphisms, CYP2D6*5 and *10, were significantly associated with lower endoxifen and higher N-desmethyltamoxifen (NDM) concentrations. Patients who were *1/*1 carriers exhibited 2.4- to 2.6-fold higher endoxifen concentrations and 1.9- to 2.1-fold lower NDM concentrations than either *10/*10 or *5/*10 carriers (P < 0.001). Similarly, the endoxifen concentrations were found to be 1.8- to 2.6-times higher in *1/*5 or *1/*10 carriers compared with *10/*10 and *5/*10 carriers (P≤ 0.001). Similar relationships were observed between the CYP2D6 polymorphisms and metabolic ratios of tamoxifen and its metabolites. No significant associations were observed with regards to the polymorphisms in CYP3A5, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. CONCLUSIONS The present study in Asian breast cancer patients showed that CYP2D6*5/*10 and *10/*10 genotypes are associated with significantly lower concentrations of the active metabolite of tamoxifen, endoxifen. Identifying such patients before the start of treatment may be useful in optimizing therapy with tamoxifen. The role of CYP3A5, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 seem to be minor. © 2011 The Authors.

abstract={Background: Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality among women in Malaysia. Delayed diagnosis is preventable and has major effects on patients' prognosis and survival. The objectives of our study were to identify the magnitude of delayed diagnosis and its associated factors in women with breast cancer in Malaysia.Methods: This study had a cross-sectional design. Respondents had histologically confirmed breast cancer and were registered at five medical centres between 2005 and 2007. All breast cancer patients who attended hospital clinics at the East Coast were included. Patients at Kuala Lumpur hospitals were selected by systematic sampling. A standardised questionnaire was developed to interview respondents. We measured the time from the first recognition of symptoms to the first general practitioners' consultation and to the histological diagnosis of breast cancer. Diagnosis delay was defined when there was more than 6 months from the recognition of symptoms to the histological diagnosis. Multiple logistic regression was used for analysis.Results: In total, 328 respondents were included. The mean (standard deviation) age was 47.9 (9.4) years. Most respondents were of Malay ethnicity, were married housewives with a median family income of RM1500 a month. Most respondents had ductal carcinoma (89.3%) and the stage distribution was as follows: 5.2% stage I, 38.7% stage II, 44.8% stage III and 11.3% stage IV. The median time to consultation was 2 months and the median time to diagnosis was 5.5 months. The frequency of diagnosis delay of more than 3 months was 72.6% and delay of more than 6 months occurred in 45.5% of the cases. The factors associated with diagnosis delay included the use of alternative therapy (odds ratio (OR) 1.77; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06, 2.94), breast ulcer (OR 5.71; 95% CI: 1.59, 20.47), palpable axillary lymph nodes (OR 2.19; 95% CI: 1.23, 3.90), false-negative diagnostic test (OR 5.32; 95% CI: 2.32, 12.21), non-cancer interpretation (OR 1.68; 95% CI: 1.01, 2.78) and negative attitude toward treatment (OR 2.09; 95% CI: 1.15, 3.82).Conclusions: Delays in consultation and diagnosis are serious problems in Malaysia. Diagnosis delay was influenced by complex interactions between many factors. Breast awareness and education are required to promote early detection, diagnosis and treatment before the tumours enlarge and metastasis. © 2011 Norsa'adah et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Human mammaglobin (hMAG) is a secreted protein which has been detected in breast epithelial cells of mammary glands and has been used as a specific marker for breast cancer. Objectives: This study aims at studying the hMAG expression and identifying the significant predictors of hMAG expression in breast cancer tissues. Materials and Methods: The tissue samples were obtained from two major teaching hospitals in the country. They were examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and the hMAG expression was evaluated using an established scoring system. Results: Out of 84 breast cancer tissue samples, hMAG was expressed in 50 samples (59.6%). The expression of hMAG was found to be increased with cancer grade. The output of logistic regression model showed that hMAG was overexpressed in breast cancer samples from the first hospital (P = 0.014), but not with those from the second hospital. Conclusions: It can be concluded that hMAG may serve in the diagnosis and the assessment of progression with the increased cancer grade. The dominance in hMAG expression in samples from HUSM may correlate with ethnic, environmental or genetic factors.},

abstract={Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among females in Malaysia. Attempts have been made to investigate the association between breast cancer and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types. However, data from those previous studies are highly variable. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between HLA-A types and clinicopathological factors in breast cancer. The frequencies of HLA-A type in 59 female patients with infiltrating ductal of the breast were determined by polymerase chain reaction method. HLA-A2/A30 and A2/A31 haplotype (5.1%; P = 0.045) as well as HLA-A30 (5.1%, P = 0.045) and A31 (6.8%; P = 0.020) allele were significant higher in the patients than controls (0%). HLA-A24 allele was negatively related to lymph node metastasis (r = -0.316; P = 0.021) whereas, A26 (r = -0.430; P = 0.001) and A36 (r = -0.430; P = 0.001) alleles were negatively correlated to distant metastasis in breast cancer. Negative correlations between HLA-A26/A36 (r = -0.430; P = 0.001), A2/A11 (r = -0.276; P = 0.044), A24/A34 (r = -0.430; P = 0.001) haplotypes and distant metastasis were identified. Interestingly, Her2 expression in breast carcinoma was negatively correlated to A11/24 haplotypes (r = -0.294; P = 0.034) but positively correlated to homozygous HLA-A24 (r = 0.396; P = 0.040). In conclusion, HLA-A2, -A30 and A31 were associated with breast cancer. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={This article is part of a larger study on the role of spirituality in coping with breast cancer among Malaysian Muslim women. The study seeks to reveal the meaning of the experience through the stories of three Muslim women surviving advanced breast cancer, to better understand the deep meanings that inform their experiences with spirituality and transformation as they cope with the challenges of breast cancer. Data were gathered using in-depth interview. Qualitative methods were used in identifying two themes-illness as an awakening and hope and freedom comes from surrendering to God. The themes were discussed in the context of two broad areas: (1) what are the new meanings these women discovered in their experiences with cancer; and (2) how did the new meanings change their lives? The study suggests that cancer survivors' experiences with cancer and their learning processes must be understood within the appropriate cultural context. This is especially so for spirituality. The common emphasis of spirituality on relationship with God, self and others, may significantly influence how people learn to live with cancer. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Introduction. Phyllodes tumors account for less than 1% of breast tumors in women, and giant phyllodes tumors are those that are larger than 10 cm in diameter. Removal of such large tumors places a huge burden on the surgeon to reconstruct a breast that is aesthetically acceptable by the patient. We report what may be the largest giant phyllodes tumor and, most likely, the first latissimus dorsi flap used to cover such a large defect caused by the resection. Case presentation. We report the case of a 36-year-old Malaysian woman who presented with a three-year history of gradually increasing swelling of the left breast, with skin changes. Examination revealed a huge, globular, lobulated mass measuring 400 mm by 350 mm. The patient had a mastectomy with an immediate latissimus dorsi pedicled myocutaneous flap reconstruction. The breast weighed 8.27 kg, and ex vivo, the tumor measured 280 mm by 250 mm by 180 mm. Histopathologic analysis confirmed the diagnosis as a giant phyllodes tumor. At 12-month follow-up, the patient reports no complications and is satisfied with the aesthetic outcome. Conclusion: Giant phyllodes tumors are very rare tumors that can reach up to 40 cm in diameter. Reconstruction of such a defect is a great challenge, and we report what we believe is the first latissimus dorsi flap to cover successfully a defect of approximately 400 mm by 350 mm. © 2011 Sarvanandan et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={The main objective of this paper is to examine the psychometric properties of the Malay Version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), tested on 67 husbands of the women who were diagnosed with breast cancer. The eligible husbands were retrieved from the Clinical Oncology Clinic at three hospitals in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Data was collected at three weeks and ten weeks following surgery for breast cancer of their wives. The psychometric properties of the HADS were reported based on Cronbach' alpha, Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC), Effect Size Index (ESI), sensitivity and discriminity of the scale. Internal consistency of the scale is excellent, with Cronbach's alpha of 0.88 for Anxiety subscale and 0.79 for Depression subscale. Test-retest Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) is 0.35 and 0.42 for Anxiety and Depression Subscale, respectively. Small mean differences were observed at test-retest measurement with ESI of 0.21 for Anxiety and 0.19 for Depression. Non-significant result was revealed for the discriminant validity (mastectomy vs lumpectomy). The Malay Version of the HADS is appropriate to measure the anxiety and depression among the husbands of the women with breast cancer in Malaysia.},

abstract={Two hospital-based breast cancer databases (University Malaya Medical Center, Malaysia [. n = 1513] and National University Hospital, Singapore [. n = 2545]) were merged into a regional registry of breast cancer patients diagnosed between 1990 and 2007. A review of the data found 51% of patients diagnosed before the age of 50 years. and 72% percent of the women were Chinese followed by Malays (16%), Indians (8%), and other races (4%). Median tumor size at presentation was 26 mm and about 25% of patients presented with TNM stage III or IV disease. Most tumors were of ductal histology (87%). Fifty-seven percent of tumors were estrogen receptor positive and 40% were poorly differentiated. Of those patients who had surgery, 70% had mastectomy while 30% had breast conserving surgery. Overall, chemotherapy was administered to 56% of patients and hormonal treatment to 60%. Five-year overall survival was 82.5% in patients with TNM stage 0 to stage II cancer, and 30.2% in those with later stages. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Background: There is improvement in breast cancer survival in the developed world, but information on breast cancer survival trends in the Asia Pacific region is limited. The aim of the study was to evaluate survival trends and factors that affect survival in Malaysia. Methods: Two prospective groups of 423 and 965 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients in University of Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia diagnosed in two time periods ie. 1993 to 1997 and in 1998 to 2002 were studied. Vital status was obtained from the National Registry of Births and Deaths. The overall survival was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of death from any cause. The survival differences between the two groups were analysed using the log-rank or Peto-Wilcoxon method. Survival estimates and independent prognostic factors were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazard models. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Analyses were performed using SPlus 2000 Professional Release 2. Results and Discussion: Median follow-up for the two groups were 55 months (SD 29.2 months) in the first group and 52 months(SD 24.43) in the second group. There was improvement in 5-year observed survival from 58.4% (CI 0.54-0.63) to 75.7% (CI 0.73-0.79). The improvement in survival was significantly seen in all co-variates (p<0.05) except for those aged 40 years and below(p= 0.27), tumour size 2 to 5 cm (p=0.11), grade 3 (p=0.32) and patients with Stage IV disease(p= 0.80). Stage of disease, lymph node (LN) involvement, size and grade were identified as independent prognostic factors in cohort one. For the second cohort; stage and LN involvement remained independent factors with the addition of ER status and ethnicity. Conclusions: There was improvement in 5-year observed survival. Besides known prognostic factors, Malay ethnicity was an independent prognostic factor.},

abstract={Background: The media play big roles in the public understanding of many health issues, and the information relayed to the public through the media clearly influences behavior. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to determine whether the content of articles on breast cancer in women published in the Star newspaper in 1997 differed from that of those published in 2007 and also to determine what factors may have caused any differences. Methodology: About 45 articles were identified for the year 1997 and 97 from the year 2007. Copies of the articles were obtained through the Star newspaper library. All the articles were read an initial time. The final sample for analysis consisted of 18 newspaper articles published in 1997 and 79 in 2007. Once data collection sheets were completed for all articles, the data were transferred to two spreadsheets and analyzed manually. Results: Living with breast cancer was the main theme of many articles in both years. Family history was emphasized as a risk factor in articles from 2007, while an inapprorpiate bra, electrical power lines, stress, smoking and alcohol were emphasized in 1997 as risk factors. In general, articles in 2007 focused on overall health practices, especially exercise, while in 1997, mammography was considered as the dominant prevention method. Conclusion: The content of the articles on breast cancer that were published in the Star newspaper in Malaysia in 1997 totally differed from that of those published in 2007. The differences seem to reflect social, political, and scientific occurrences over the period studied.},

abstract={Introduction: The age standardised incidence rate (ASR) of breast cancer in Malaysia which is a high middle-income country is similar to Indonesia, a low middle-income country. (Globocan 2008) It is however unknown whether the presentation of breast cancer differs between these two countries. Objective: We compared the stage, age at presentation, and pathological characteristics of breast cancer between two tertiary hospitals in Indonesia and Malaysia; Dharmais Cancer Centre (DCC), which is the national cancer referral centre in Indonesia, and University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC), which is an academic hospital with established breast oncology services in Kuala Lumpur. One thousand, one hundred and fourteen consecutive women (477 in UMMC: 637 in DCC) who were newly diagnosed with breast cancer between January and December, 2010 were included. Patient's age, TNM stage at presentation, and pathological characteristics were compared. Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) were considered positive if 10% or greater of invasive cell nuclei were stained while HER2 was considered positive with an immunohistochemostry staining intensity of 3+. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify differences. Results: Median age at diagnosis was 52 years in UMMC and 47 years in DCC, whereby patients in DCC were more likely to be very young at diagnosis (aged < 35 years) compared to their counterparts in UMMC (Odds ratio (OR): 2.09; 95%CI: 1.32-3.31). Approximately one third of patients in UMMC presented with TNM stage III or IV, compared to 63% in DCC. Patients in DCC were three times more likely to present with metastatic breast cancer compared to patients in UMMC (OR: 3.01; 95% CI: 2.02-4.48). The percentage of low grade tumours in DCC was higher than in UMMC (28% vs 11% respectively), and the difference persisted even after multivariate adjustment. Although the frequency of ER and PR positivity appeared to be higher in UMMC (65% and 55% respectively) compared to DCC (48% and 40% respectively), these differences were not statistically significant following adjustment for age, stage, HER2 status and grade. The frequency of HER2 positivity was 45% in DCC compared to 26% in UMMC, and remained significantly higher even after multivariate adjustment (multivarite OR:1.76; 95%CI:1.25-2.47, in DCC compared to UMMC). The proportion of triple negative breast cancer was however similar in the two centres (19% in UMMC vs 21% in DCC). Conclusion: Indonesian women with breast cancer seem to present at a younger age and at later stages compared to Malaysian women. Their tumors were more likely to be of low grade and HER2 positive, even after adjustment for other factors, while hormone receptor positivity proved similar in the two groups. The higher HER2 positivity rate in Indonesian patients warrants further study.},

abstract={Background: Fat intake has been shown to play a role in the etiology of breast cancer, but the findings have been inconsistent. Objective: To assess the association of premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer risk with fat and fat subtypes intake. Methodology: This is a population based case-control study conducted in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia from January 2006 to December 2007. Food intake pattern was collected from 382 breast cancer patients and 382 control group via an interviewer-administered food frequency questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to compute odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and a broad range of potential confounders was included in analysis. Results: This study showed that both premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer risk did not increase significantly with greater intake of total fat [quartile (Q) 4 versus Q1 OR=0.76, 95% CI, 0.23-2.45 and OR=1.36, 95% CI, 0.30-3.12], saturated fat (ORQ4 to Q1=1.43, 95% CI, 0.51-3.98 and ORQ4 to Q1=1.75, 95% CI, 0.62-3.40), monounsaturated fat (ORQ4 to Q1=0.96, 95% CI, 0.34-1.72 and ORQ4 to Q1=1.74, 95% CI, 0.22-2.79), polyunsaturated fat (ORQ4 to Q1=0.64, 95% CI, 0.23-1.73 and ORQ4 to Q1=0.74, 95% CI, 0.39-1.81), n-3 polyunsaturated fat (ORQ4 to Q1=1.10, 95% CI, 0.49-2.48 and ORQ4 to Q1=0.78, 95% CI, 0.28-2.18), n-6 polyunsaturated fat (ORQ4 to Q1=0.67, 95% CI, 0.24-1.84 and ORQ4 to Q1=0.71, 95% CI, 0.29-1.04) or energy intake (ORQ4 to Q1=1.52, 95% CI, 0.68-3.38 and ORQ4 to Q1=2.21, 95% CI, 0.93-3.36). Conclusion: Total fat and fat subtypes were not associated with pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer risk after controlling for age, other breast cancer risk factors and energy intake. Despite the lack of association, the effects of total fat and fat subtypes intake during premenopausal years towards postmenopausal breast cancer risk still warrant investigation.},

abstract={Background: Breast cancer has been increased in South East Asia countries, but there are limited data for breast cancer risk factors in these countries. To clarify the risk for breast cancer among the Malaysian women, a matched case-control study was conducted. Method: Between October 2009 and April 2010, a survey was prospectively conducted among women admitted to clinics of Penang General Hospital for examination and/or treatment by using a questionnaire. Therefore, characteristics of patients diagnosed with breast cancer (n = 150) were compared with control cases (n = 150) admitted to hospital for non-neoplastic, non-hormone related diseases. Results: Family history of a distant relative with breast cancer (OR= 2.84), history of first-degree relatives with breast cancer (OR= 2.95), history of benign breast disease (OR= 2.43), menstrual irregularity (OR= 4.24), and use of oral contraceptive pills (OCP) (OR= 2.15) were found to be significant risk factors for breast cancer in our population. Furthermore, education more than 11 years (OR= 0.40), breastfeeding (OR= 0.50), being employed (OR= 0.45) and practicing low fat diet (OR= 0.53) were strongly protective against breast cancer development. Conclusion: The results emphasize the importance of conducting a series of awareness campaigns that highlights the protective role of longer breastfeeding period against breast cancer and the negative relationships between OCP use and high fat diet with this disease.},

abstract={Introduction: Nausea and vomiting are recognized as two separate and distinct conditions with a wide spectrum of etiologies either directly associated with cancer itself or its treatment. According to the new ranking of chemotherapy side effects, nausea is the number one or the most disturbing side effects while vomiting is the third and sometimes the fifth. The introduction of 5-HT3-recptor antagonists in the early of 1990s has revolutionized the treatment of nausea and vomiting, these agents remaining the mainstay of antiemetic therapy today. Ethnic variation (due to genetic polymorphisms) may lead to diversity in antiemetic treatment pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, in terms of distribution, elimination, disposition and clinical effects. The aim of the present study was to clarify genetic polymorphism effects in the three main races in Malaysia i.e., Malay, Chinese and Indian, on the clinical antiemetic effects of granisetron. Methods: In this longitudinal prospective observational study, 158 breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy were monitored for nausea and vomiting in the first 24 hours after chemotherapy administration. The patients were then followed up again after 3 to 5 days of chemotherapy. Results: Genetic polymorphisms in the three races in Malaysia have significant effect on granisetron clinical antiemetic action because each is characterized by variant CYP3A4 enzymatic action. Conclusion: According to the result, different type of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, such as tropisetron and dolasetron which are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6, should be used especially for Chinese breast cancer patients.},

abstract={Introduction: Advanced presentation of breast cancer and the problem of late diagnosis is well documented. Patient delay beyond three months has been shown to reduce survival. This paper aims to explore the experience of Malaysian women presenting with advanced breast cancer with regards to their interpretation of breast symptoms. Method: Purposive sampling of 19 breast cancer patients presenting with delayed treatment and/or advanced cancer diagnosed within two years at the University Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur were carried out. In-depth interviews were conducted using a self-devised interview guide. The interview guide covered the journey of the patient from discovering of symptoms to their present state. The audiotaped interviews were transcribed verbatim. NVivo 8 qualitative software was utilised for data management. Grounded theory with thematic analysis was utilised. Results: Nine women delayed seeking diagnosis although recognizing the symptom, five did not recognize symptom, three delayed treatment and two did not delay health attention. Themes that emerged with regards to triggering help seeking behavior were: a) poor symptom knowledge and recognition; b) importance of knowledge of the disease and its' outcomes; c) role of coping mechanisms and affect; and lastly d) role of significant others in appraising a breast symptom. Conclusion: Symptom recognition remains an important public health issue in Malaysia. Educating women, their significant others and primary health and primary care providers in detecting early staged breast cancer are needed. Supporting and sanctioning women with breast symptoms are important. The psycho-social-cultural model of symptom appraisal may serve as an important addition to the fight against cancer in countries that do not have the resources for population based screening mammogram programmes.},

abstract={Breast cancer is the most frequently occurring cancer in women globally and early detection increases the survival rate of patients. Therefore, this study was done to determine factors which influence the awareness of breast cancer and practice of screening procedures. A cross-sectional study was performed on 125 women aged 19-60 years in urban and rural areas in Malaysia using a validated questionnaire covering knowledge of breast cancer and screening practices. A total of 99.2% respondents knew that breast cancer is the leading cancer with a mean knowledge of 67.3 ± 15.3% for urban and 50.2 ± 14.7% for rural women Mann Whitney U showed rural women had significantly less awareness compared to urban women (p> 0.05). Spearman correlation test showed a significant positive relationship between education and awareness (p> 0.05). Regarding awareness of the screening methods, 92.8%, 50.4% and 47.2% of respondents correctly answered questions on capability of BSE, CBE and mammography, respectively. In conclusion, the study showed awareness of breast cancer and practice of screening procedures increases with higher education and urban living.

abstract={Background: Advanced breast cancer is common in less affluent parts of Asia. The impact of breast surgery on survival of women presenting with metastatic breast cancer in this setting was investigated. Methods: Women presenting with metastatic breast cancer at the initial diagnosis at the University Malaya Medical Centre (Malaysia) between 1993 and 2008 were included in the study. Mortality of patients who had primary breast surgery was compared with that of those without surgery, and adjusted for possible confounders by means of a propensity score. Results: Of 3689 patients, 375 (10·2 per cent) presented with metastatic disease. One hundred and thirty-nine patients (37·1 per cent) underwent surgery. A total of 330 deaths occurred during 6814 person-months of follow-up. The 2-year survival rate was 21·2 (95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) 15·9 to 26·5) per cent in women who did not have surgery and 46·3 (37·7 to 54·9) per cent in those who had breast surgery. Breast surgery was associated with a 28 per cent lower risk of death (hazard ratio 0·72, 95 per cent c.i. 0·56 to 0·94), after adjustment for patient and tumour characteristics, metastatic profile and treatment. Conclusion: Surgical resection of the primary breast tumour was independently associated with a survival advantage in patients presenting with metastatic breast cancer.

abstract={Background: A cross-sectional study was carried out to determine the prevalence of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use by breast cancer survivors. Methods: A descriptive survey design was developed. Information on sociodemographic characteristics, cancer clinical treatment history, and use of CAM were obtained through a modified selfadministered questionnaire from 116 Malay breast cancer survivors aged 21 to 67 years who were 2 years postdiagnosis and currently undergoing follow-up treatment at breast cancer clinics at Hospital Kuala Lumpur and Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre. Results: Data suggest that 64% of the participants were identified as CAM users; dietary supplements were the most common form used, followed by prayer and Malay traditional medicine. Within the wide range of dietary supplements, multivitamins were most often taken followed by spirulina, vitamin C, evening primrose oil, and herbal products. Contrary to other findings, the CAM users were found to be older, had secondary education levels, and were from middle-income households. However, there was no signifi cant difference between CAM users and nonusers in this study. Family members played an important role as the main source of information along with doctors/health care providers, friends, and printed materials/mass media. The reasons participants gave for using CAM were mainly to assist in healing the body's inner strength, to cure cancer, and to reduce stress. Only half of the participants consulted with their physicians regarding the safety of CAM use. The participants began to use CAM while undergoing clinical treatments. Most of the participants used CAM for more than a year. About RM100 to RM149 (31.88 USD to 47.50 USD at press time) were spent monthly on CAM by 32% of the participants. The CAM use was found to be effective and beneficial for patients' disease states, and they were contented with the usage of the CAM therapies. Multivariate analysis revealed that the decision to use or not to use CAM was not dependent on sociodemographic background or cancer clinical treatment history. Conclusions: CAM was commonly used by breast cancer survivors as a coping mechanism to battle the disease.},

abstract={Background: Cancer and chemotherapy are sources of anxiety and worry for cancer patients. Information provision is therefore very important to empower them to overcome and adjust to the stressful experience. Thus, nurses should be aware of the informational needs of the patients throughout the course of their care. Purpose: The purpose of the study was to identify the important information required by breast cancer patients during the first and fourth cycles of chemotherapy from both the patients' and nurses' perceptions. Methodology: This is a longitudinal study used a questionnaire adapted from the Toronto Informational Needs Questionnaires-Breast Cancer (TINQ-BC). Some modifications were made to meet the specific objectives of the study. The study was conducted in the Chemotherapy Day Care at the University of Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC), Malaysia. A total of 169 breast cancer patients who met the inclusion criteria, and 39 nurses who were involved in their care were recruited into the study. Results: The overall mean scores at first and fourth cycle of chemotherapy were 3.91 and 3.85 respectively: i.e., between 3 (or important) and 4 (or very important), which indicated a high level of informational needs. There was no significant difference in information needed by the breast cancer patients between the two cycles of chemotherapy (p=0.402). The most important information was from the subscale of disease, followed closely by treatment, physical care, investigative tests and psychosocial needs. Nurses had different views on the important information needed by breast cancer patients at both time points (p = 0.023). Conclusions: Breast cancer patients on chemotherapy have high levels of informational needs with no significant differences in information needed at first cycle as opposed to fourth cycle. There were differences between the perceptions of the breast cancer patients and the nurses on important information needed.

abstract={The main aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the knowledge, attitudes and perception about breast cancer among students from different ethnic groups. A qualitative study was conducted among the multiethnic students at a Malaysian public university in Penang Island. The ethnic groups which were approached were Malay, Indians, Chinese, Arabs and Thais. On an average, fifteen students from every group was a part of the study. A questionnaire was used to evaluate the respondents' knowledge about the symptoms, causes and the treatment of breast cancer. A self designed 15 items questionnaire was used to achieve the objective of the study. A total of N=125 students were approached for their participation in the study. However, only n=102 showed a willingness to be a part of the study. The mean age of the respondents was 24 ± 4.46. Overall, the findings demonstrated that the Thai students had comparatively better knowledge than the other groups. In terms of diagnosis, mammography and physical examination were recommended by a majority of the students. Surgery and radiation therapy were the preferred options to treat breast cancer. Thai students had good knowledge about the symptoms of breast cancer. However, the knowledge level towards the diagnosis of breast cancer was best among the Malays and the Arabs. Overall, the findings highlighted the need of further educational sessions among all the groups for the substitution of negative perceptions with positive and evident beliefs about the symptoms, causes, prevention, diagnosis and the treatment of breast cancer.},

abstract={Low intensity exercise but with potential benefits was more preferable as an alternative to more vigorous exercise when striving for health benefits for breast cancer patients and survivors. The present study seeks to understand the roles of mind-body exercise particularly Guolin Qigong in the health care of breast cancer survivors in Malaysia, the motivation factors that drove these survivors to practise a low intensity exercise such as Guolin Qigong and the outcomes gained from this exercise. A purposive sampling technique and in-depth interview was employed to 13 informants from five regions in Malaysia. The findings of the study indicated that the Qigong exercise has developed self-empowerment and helped these women to be responsible for their own life particularly physical, psychosocial and spiritual. It also serves as an avenue for support and communication among the breast cancer survivors. The motivations from them to practise Qigong were supported by the need of these women to survive and their belief in this Guolin Qigong in healing their cancer and its adaptable form of exercise which led to their enjoyment into integrating this exercise into their daily routine. The outcome gained from this exercise were feeling good, lessened anxiety, found peacefulness, strengthen immune system and found internal strength and direction in fighting their cancer. Lastly, this study provided better understanding for all cancer patients and survivors the roles of Guolin Qigong exercise in enhancing quality of life for cancer patients and survivors. These findings can be used to health practitioners and health providers to promote Guolin Qigong exercise and motivate all cancer patients and survivors to practise Guolin Qigong. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Breast cancer is a leading cause of worldwide mortality in females. In Malaysia, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women. Of these, the Chinese had the most number of breast cancer cases, followed by the Indian and the Malay. The most common type of breast cancer is infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC). A proteomic approach was used to identify protein profile changes in cancerous tissues compared with the normal tissues, the tissues were collected from patients of three different ethnicities, i.e. Chinese, Malay and Indian. Ten differentially expressed hydrophobic proteins were identified. We had evaluated the potential of these proteins as biomarker for infiltrating ducal carcinoma (IDC) and the ethnic-specific expression of these proteins was also determined. The data showed that peroxiredoxin-2, heat shock protein 60, protein disulfide isomerase and calreticulin may serve as ethnic-related potential markers for either one or combination of Chinese, Malay and Indian cohorts as their expression levels were significantly high in the cancerous tissues compared to the normal tissues in the ethnic group tested. © 2010/2011 - IOS Press and the authors.

abstract={Overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor-related gene ErbB2 occurs in 18% to 25% of patients with breast cancer in Western countries and is associated with a poor prognosis. The prevalence of ErbB2-positive tumors in Asia is unclear, partly because data are limited. The objective of this review was to summarize the reported prevalence of ErbB2-positive tumors from a large sample of Asian patients and to examine ErbB2 assessment methods in Asia. From searches of MEDLINE, local language journals, and local and international conference proceedings as well as locoregional breast cancer experts' recommendations, the authors selected up to 5 studies each from India, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand that reported ErbB2 results based on assessment with immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The reported prevalence of ErbB2-positive tumors in 22 studies on 24,671 patients, of whom 14,398 patients were assessed for ErbB2 status, varied widely (range, 6%-65%) as did the assessment methods used. Most studies (n = 21) used IHC to assess ErbB2 status, but definitions for positivity varied. When robust assessment methods were used, the median prevalence was 19% based on strong IHC staining (IHC3+; n = 9812 patients) and 25% based on FISH (n = 681 patients). Data on the prevalence of ErbB2-positive breast cancer in Asia are limited. The current survey indicated that the prevalence in Asia may be similar to that in Western countries; thus, up to 1 in 4 Asian patients with breast cancer potentially could benefit from ErbB2-targeted treatment. A standard, reliable ErbB2 assessment method available to patients across Asia is urgently required. Cancer 2010. © 2010 American Cancer Society. The reported prevalence of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ErbB2)-positive tumors in Asia varied widely, in part because of the lack of standard, reliable testing methods. When only robust methods were considered, the prevalence of ErbB2-positive tumors in Asia was similar to that in Western countries. Copyright © 2010 American Cancer Society.},

abstract={The GATA3 gene is a potential tumour marker and putative tumour suppressor gene in breast cancer. Its expression is associated with better prognosis and disease free survival in breast cancer patients. We aimed to evaluate GATA3 transcriptome expression and mutation in breast carcinomas and correlate its expression with oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), lymph node (LN) status, tumour grade and c-erbB-2 expression. Twenty-two breast infi ltrating ductal carcinomas and paired normal tissues were used in Branch DNA assay to detect GATA3 mRNA expression. Normalized data for GATA3 mRNA expression were grouped according to the ER, PR and LN status, tumour grade and c-erbB-2 expression of the tumours. Statistical signifi cance was tested using t-test and ANOVA at 95% confi dence interval level. Mutational analysis of GATA3 was performed by direct sequencing of the coding regions of GATA3 mRNA. Our findings showed that GATA3 gene were over-expressed and under-expressed by >2 fold change in 12 and 4 tested samples, respectively. Eighty per cent of ER positive breast carcinomas were GATA3 positive. There was a statistically signifi cant correlation between GATA3 expression and ER at 95% confi dence interval level between the study groups. On the contrary, GATA3 expression was not statistically signifi cant with PR, LN, tumour grade and c-erbB-2 expression in our study. In addition, we observed that there was no mutation in mRNA coding region in 16 breast carcinomas that showed GATA3 differential gene expression. Our preliminary results suggested that GATA3 is linked to the ER. This scenario suggests that GATA3 may play a crucial role in oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer patients. Whether GATA3 expression is involved in regulating tumour cell growth in oestrogen responsive breast cancer is a key question that remains to be answered.},

Peripheral blood samples were collected from 387 breast cancer patients and 252 normal and healthy women who had no history of any malignancy. The genotype (P=0.023) and allele (P=0.008) frequencies of L55M polymorphism were significantly different between the breast cancer cases and normal individuals. However, the distribution of genotype (P=0.333) and allele (P=0.163) frequencies of Q192R polymorphism showed lack of statistical significance. Women who were MM homozygotes (OR=2.229; 95% CI, 1.219-4.075) and carriers of M allele genotype (OR=1.429; 95% CI, 1.035-1.974) or M allele (OR=1.397; 95% CI, 1.093-1.785) were associated with increased risk of breast cancer. However, women who were heterozygous (OR=0.793; 95% CI, 0.567-1.110) or homozygous (OR=0.746; 95% CI, 0.407-1.370) for R allele or carriers of R allele (OR=0.838; 95%, 0.654-1.074) were not associated with breast cancer risk. The M allele genotype was significantly associated with estrogen receptor negativity (P=0.046) and nodal involvement (P=0.004) but R allele genotype was not associated with any of the clinico-pathological characteristics. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the polymorphic variant of L55M polymorphism could be a useful genetic marker for tumor prognosis and to identify women who might be at greater risk of developing breast cancer in a hospital-based Malaysian population. © 2010 Arányi Lajos Foundation.},

abstract={The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between the Glyoxalase I (GLOI) Ala111Glu polymorphism and breast cancer risk among the major Malaysian ethnic groups, the Malays, Chinese and Indians, as well as clinico-pathological characteristics of these patients. Genotyping of GLOI gene was performed on blood samples obtained from 387 patients and 252 normal healthy women who had no history of any malignancy using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. The genotype and allele frequencies of GLOI polymorphism were not significantly different between the patients and normal individuals among the Malays (P = 0.721, 0.402), Chinese (P = 0.208, 0.079) and Indians (P = 0.612, 0.349), respectively. The Malay, Chinese and Indian women who were Glu/Glu homozygotes (P = 0.419, 0.093, 0.367), Ala/Glu heterozygotes (P = 0.648, 0.182, 0.402) and carriers of Glu allele (P = 0.402, 0.079, 0.349), respectively, were not associated with breast cancer risk. The Glu allele genotype was significantly associated with absence of progesterone receptor (P = 0.036). Thus, the polymorphic variant of the GLOI gene might not be a useful genetic marker to identify Malaysian Malay, Chinese or Indian women who could be at greater risk of developing breast cancer.

It is suggested that a subset of breast cancer cases were associated with germline mutation in breast cancer susceptibility (BRCA) genes. Most of the BRCA mutations reported in Malaysia were point mutations, small deletions and insertions. Here we report the first study of BRCA large genomic rearrangements (LGRs) in Malaysia. We aimed to detect the presence of LGRs in the BRCA genes of Malaysian patients with breast cancer. Methods: Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) for BRCA LGRs was carried out on 100 patients (60 were high-risk breast cancer patients previously tested negative/positive for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, and 40 were sporadic breast cancer patients), recruited from three major referral centres, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre (UKMMC), Hospital Kuala Lumpur (HKL) and Hospital Putrajaya (HPJ). Results: Two novel BRCA1 rearrangements were detected in patients with sporadic breast cancer; both results were confirmed by quantitative PCR. No LGRs were found in patients with high-risk breast cancer. The two large genomic rearrangements detected were genomic amplifications of exon 3 and exon 10. No BRCA2 genomic rearrangement was found in both high-risk and sporadic breast cancer patients. Conclusion: These results will be helpful to understand the mutation spectrum of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in Malaysian patients with breast cancer. Further studies involving larger samples are required to establish a genetic screening strategy for both high-risk and sporadic breast cancer patients. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Activation of Akt signaling pathway has been documented in various human malignancies, including breast carcinoma. The objective of this study is to determine the incidence of Akt phosphorylation in breast tumours and its relationship with expression of ER-α, ER-β, HER2, Ki-67 and phosphorylated Bcl-2 associated death domain (p-BAD). Immunohistochemical staining was performed to detect these molecules on 43 paraffin-embedded breast tumour tissues with commercially available antibodies. Eighteen (41.9%), 3 (7.0%), 23 (53.5%), 35 (81.4%), 21 (48.8%), 29 (67.4%), and 34 (81.0%) of breast tumours were positive for nuclear ER-α, nuclear ER-β, membranous HER2, cytonuclear p-Akt (Thr308), p-Akt (Ser473), p-BAD and Ki-67, respectively. ER-α expression was inversely correlated with HER2 and Ki-67 (P=0.041 and P=0.040, respectively). The p-Akt (Ser473) was correlated with increased level of p-BAD (Ser136) (P=0.012). No relationship of Akt phosphorylation with HER2, ER-α or ER-β was found. The p-Akt (Ser473) immunoreactivity was significantly higher in stage IV than in stage I or II (P=0.036 or P=0.009). The higher Ki-67 and lower ER-α expression showed an association with patient age of <50 years (P=0.004) and with positive nodal status(P=0.033), respectively. Our data suggest that the Aktphosphorylation and inactivation of its downstream target, BAD may play a role in survival of breast cancer cell. This study does not support the simple model of linear HER2/ PI3K/Akt pathway in breast cancer. © Arányi Lajos Foundation 2009.},

abstract={Genomic and transcriptomic alterations that affect cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and invasion, commonly occur in breast oncogenesis. Epidemiological evidence has proven that the risk of breast cancer predisposition varies among different ethnicities. This study aims to identify the transcriptome changes that commonly occur during the transition of normal breast epithelium to carcinoma in three local ethnic groups (Malays, Chinese and Indians). The gene expression patterns of 43 breast carcinomas with 43 patient-matched normal breast tissues were investigated using Affymetrix U133A GeneChip® (containing 22,283 probe sets targeting ~18,400 different transcripts) and analyzed with GeneSpring® GX10. Our findings revealed a total of 33 significantly differentially expressed genes, which showed&gt;2-fold change at a 99.9% confidence interval level (p&lt;0.001). The significantly differentially expressed genes included CD24, CD36, CD9, TACSTD1, TACSTD2, HBB, LEP, LPL, AKR1C1, AKR1C2 and AKR1C3. Our results indicate that the vast majority of gene expression changes, from normal breast epithelial to carcinoma, found in our three major ethnic populations are similar to those in the Caucasian population. Further study of the differentially expressed genes identified in our present study is needed to search for potential breast tumor biomarkers. This will eventually help to improve the therapeutic and treatment strategies for breast cancer patients in the future. © 2009 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract={Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among women of all ethnic and age groups in Malaysia. Objective: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the knowledge of breast cancer risk factors, symptoms and methods of screening among female university students and their perception towards the disease treatment outcomes. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from February to March 2008 at Universiti Sains Malaysia. Two hundred participants from 10 randomly selected faculties were interviewed face to face by a trained pharmacist using a validated questionnaire. In addition to their demographic characteristics, participants were required to answer 22 questions concerning knowledge of breast cancer and five questions related to their perception of breast cancer management and treatment outcomes. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 15. Results: The mean age of the respondents was 26.7 (SD=1.9) years. The results showed that the vast majority of the female university students had inadequate knowledge of breast cancer. The mean total knowledge score of the students was 60.7%. Indian students had significantly less knowledge of breast cancer compared to their Chinese and Malay counterparts (p<0.05). However, more than two third of the students were aware of breast self examination (BSE) and clinical breast examination (CBE) recommendations. Furthermore, the students had positive perceptions towards the treatment outcomes of breast cancer. Conclusion: This study has highlighted the need of a breast cancer awareness campaign, which should also stress the importance of early detection and reporting of breast cancer.},

abstract={Introduction: Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is one of the most important worries of cancer patients. Although not life-threatening, it has a great negative impact on quality of life (QOL). Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the impact of CINV (i.e., acute and delayed) on breast cancer patients QOL and to discern opinions related with antiemetic guidelines used dependent on the three main races in Malaysia (Malay, Chinese, Indian). Methods: In this longitudinal prospective observational study, 158 breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy were interviewed and valid questionnaires (MANE and ONEM) were used to report the impact of CINV on their QOL within the first 24 hours and after 3 to 5 days of chemotherapy treatment. Results: The main result was that delayed CINV has an impact on QOL greater than acute CINV. The impact of nausea was reportedly higher than that of vomiting. Also differences in race i.e., genetic polymorphisms (pharmacogenomics) influenced the utility of antiemetic treatments and patients opinions. Conclusion: Based on the results of our study a new guideline for antiemetic treatment should be used to reduce the impact of CINV on QOL, taking into account variation in genetic polymorphisms among the three races in Malaysia.},

abstract={Breast cancer is a leading cause of mortality in women. In Malaysia, it is the most common cancer to affect women. The most common form of breast cancer is infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC). A proteomic approach was undertaken to identify protein profile changes between cancerous and normal breast tissues from 18 patients. Two protein extracts; aqueous soluble and membrane associated protein extracts were studied. Thirty four differentially expressed proteins were identified. The intensities of the proteins were used as variables in PCA and reduced data of six principal components (PC) were subjected to LDA in order to evaluate the potential of these proteins as collective biomarkers for breast cancer. The protein intensities of SEC13-like 1 (isoform b) and calreticulin contributed the most to the first PC while the protein intensities of fibrinogen beta chain precursor and ATP synthase D chain contributed the most to the second PC. Transthyretin precursor and apolipoprotein A-1 precursor contributed the most to the third PC. The results of LDA indicated good classification of samples into normal and cancerous types when the first 6 PCs were used as the variables. The percentage of correct classification was 91.7% for the originally grouped tissue samples and 88.9% for cross-validated samples. © 2010 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the commonest cancer affecting women world wide. Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer related mortality in Asian countries. Management of breast cancer depends on several tumour-related and patient related factors. HER-2/neu over-expression has been associated with a poor prognosis in breast cancer. We assessed HER-2/neu over expression pattern in unselected breast cancer cases in terms of clinico-pathologic parameters to identify any associations between them. METHODS: Two hundred cases of breast cancer were evaluated at Advanced Medical and Dental Institute and Hospital Kepala Batas from 2002 to 2007. HER-2/neu status was confirmed in breast cancer tissues by immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemical expression of HER-2/neu was evaluated according to the published scoring guidelines of the 'Hercep Test' (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). Data were analysed to identify any association between HER-2/neu and clinico-pathologic parameters. RESULTS: HER-2/neu over expression was found in 63 (31.5%) tumours out of 200. When assessed for various age groups no significant association was found. However, a high percentage (75%) of over-expression was noted in the 81-85 years age group. No association was found with different racial groups (Malay, Chinese and Indians), with lymph node status or with grade of tumour. However a positive association was observed with oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor expression. CONCLUSION: There was no association between HER-2/neu over expression and age, race, lymph node status or tumor grade. However a positive association was found with oestrogen and progesterone receptor status.},

abstract={Background: Information about elderly breast cancer patients' outcome is limited. This study aimed to evaluate the treatment outcomes in women aged 70 and above with specific analysis on prognostic clinicopathological features and treatment modalities. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study examined breast cancer patients between 1st January 1994 and 31st December 2004 in UMMC. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and comparisons between groups using the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate analysis on prognostic factors were carried out using the Cox's proportionate hazard model for patient demographics, and tumour and treatment factors. Results: One hundred and thirty six patients were identified, with a median age at diagnosis of 75 years. Most had at least one co-morbidity (61.8%). Only 75.0% had a good performance status (ECOG 0-1). Mean tumour size was 4.4cm. Primary tumour stages (T stages) 3 and 4 were present in 8.1% and 30.1% of patients respectively, and 30.9% had stage III and 8.8% had stage IV disease based on overall AJCC staging. ER positivity was 58.1%. PR status was positive in 30.1%. Surgery was performed in 69.1% of the patients and mastectomy and axillary clearance were the commonest surgical procedures (50.7%). Some 79.4% of patients received hormonal therapy, 30.1% radiotherapy and only 3.6% chemotherapy. Nonstandard treatment was given to 39.0% of patients due to a variety of reasons. The cumulative 5 years overall, relapse free and cause specific survivals were 51.9%, 79.7% and 73.3% respectively. Performance status, T3-4 tumour, presence of metastasis, tumour grade and ER status were independent prognostic factors for overall survival. For cause specific survival they were T4 tumour, presence of metastasis and ER status. Conclusion: The 5 years overall survival rate was 51.9% and 41.8% of deaths were non-breast cancer related deaths. Low survival rate was related to low life expectancy in this population. Locally advanced disease, metastatic disease and high ER negative rates play a major role in the survival of elderly breast cancer patients in Malaysia.},

abstract={Objective: With increasing survival rates, breast cancer is now considered a chronic condition necessitating innovative care to meet the long-term needs of survivors. This paper presents the findings of a pilot study on self-management for women diagnosed with breast cancer and their implications for Asian health care providers. Methods: A pre-test/post-test pilot study was conducted to gain preliminary insights into program feasibility and barriers to participation, and to provide justification for a larger trial. Results: The study found the 4 week self management program feasible and acceptable, with a favourable trend in quality of life. The recruitment barriers ranged from competing medical appointments, uncollaborative health providers, linguistic barriers and social-household concerns. Supporting facilitators identified were family, health professionals and fellow participants ("buddies"). Lessons from the study are discussed with regard to Asian health providers. Conclusion: There is preliminary evidence that self management is a workable and potentially useful model even in an Asians entrenched-hierarchical medical model of care. The initial challenge was breaking down barriers in acceptancee of a collaborative stance. A clinical trial is now warranted to gather more evidence.},

abstract={Background: Lack of physical activities throughout life is related to obesity and is a risk factor of breast cancer, however, the associations of these factors with adiponectin in the occurrence of breast cancer have not been well investigated. Objective: This study investigated the relationship between adiposity, lifetime physical activities and serum adiponectin as breast cancer risk factors among Malaysian women in Klang Valley, Malaysia. Design: A case-control study was carried out among 70 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients and 138 controls aged 29 to 65 years old in Klang Valley. Subjects: The inclusion criteria for both groups were not having menstruation for premenopausal women, no evidence of pregnancy, not lactating and no chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes at the time of data collection. In addition, the cases must be pathologically newly diagnosed with breast cancer (stage I to III) and not on any therapy for cancer, with the exception of surgery. The controls were matched with cases for age ± 5 years and menopausal status. Measurements: Subjects were interviewed to obtain information on socio-demography, health and reproductive history using a pretested questionnaire. Subjects were also asked on their engagement of physical activity since secondary school. Anthropometric parameters included height, weight, waist and hips were also measured. A total of 6 ml of fasting venous blood was drawn for analysis of serum adiponectin in duplicate using Linko Adiponectin ELISA Kit. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) and blood pressure were also measured. Results: Mean body mass index (BMI) among cases and controls were not significantly different (p>0.05) at 26.1 ± 4.8 kg/m2 and 25.3 ± 4.5 kg/m2, respectively. FBG among cases (6.3 ± 1.8 mmol/L) was higher than controls (5.6 ± 1.1 mmol/L) (p<0.05). Waist hip ratio (WHR) of cases (0.85 ± 0.07) was also higher than controls (0.80 ± 0.06) (p<0.05). Abdominal obesity (WHR >0.85) increased risk of breast cancer by three folds [Adjusted OR 3.3 (95%CI 1.8-6.2)] (p<0.05). Adiponectin level was inversely related to waist circumference (r=-0.510, p=0.000), BMI (r=-0.448, p=0.000) and FBG (r=-0.290, p=0.026). Adiponectin level in cases (11.9 ± 4.8 μg/ml) were lower than controls (15.2 ± 7.3 μg/ml) (p<0.05). A greater reduction of breast cancer risk was observed with the increasing level of serum adiponectin level according to percentiles (p<0.05). Subjects with mean serum adiponectin level at the highest quintile (>75th)(≥16.7 μg/ml) had 80% reduced risk of breast cancer [Adjusted OR 0.2 (0.0-0.6)](p<0.05). A higher percentage of cases (47%) had not engaged in any physical activity throughout life as compared to controls (19%)[Adjusted OR 3.7 (1.7-7.7)](p<0.001). Conclusions: Abdominal obesity and physical inactivity throughout life were associated with low serum adiponectin and breast cancer risk among subjects. Thus, it is essential for Malaysian women to be physically active and achieve a healthy waistline in order to increase serum adiponectin level and reduce breast cancer risk.},

abstract={Despite being the major cause of cancer-related death in Malaysian women, local data on patterns of breast cancer relapse and their long term outcomes are still scarce. We conducted a retrospective study on all patients treated for non-metastatic invasive breast cancer in 1999-2000 at the University of Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC), who subsequently developed relapse. We sought to analyse the patterns of relapse, their associated clinicopathological features and the overall survival ratefollowing the relapses. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to analyse demographics and clinicopathological factors. Survival was analysed using the Kaplan and Meier method and compared by the log rank test. A total of 268 patients with a mean age of 50, were identified for the study. At a median follow-up of 50 months, 73 patients (27.2%) had relapsed. Local, regional and distant relapse rates were 5.5%, 1.9% and 19.8% respectively, whereas, the 5-year survival rates were 61%, 40% and 21% respectively (p < 0.01). Most relapses occurred within the first five years of diagnosis. Patients with long disease-free interval had better survival. The most common distant relapse site was the lungs while bone was the distant relapse site with the best prognosis. Disease stage, nodal status and oestrogen receptor status were found to have correlation with the risk of relapse. We concluded that the survival of patients with relapsed breast cancer was associated with the site(s) of first relapse and the disease free interval and clinicopathological factors can be used to predict the risk of relapse.},

abstract={This study describes weight changes experienced by Malaysian women with breast cancer. Women with breast cancer (n=368) were recruited from eight hospitals and four breast cancer support groups in Peninsular Malaysia. Current weight was measured and weight at the time of diagnosis and a year preceding diagnosis were based on self-reports. Change in weight was determined from the year preceding breast cancer diagnosis to study entry (time 1), at the time of diagnosis to study entry (time 2) and from a year preceding breast cancer diagnosis to the time of diagnosis (time 3). Current body mass index, at a year preceding diagnosis and at the time of diagnosis were determined. Waist circumference was also measured. The sample comprised 57% Malay, 34% Chinese and 9.8% Indian women. The mean age of the women was 54 ± 9.04 years and over 80% were postmenopausal. Majority of the women were in stage I and stage II breast cancer at the time of diagnosis. The most common treatments received by these women were chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy and mastectomy. Overweight and obesity were prevalent in over 40% of the survivors at all three periods. Significant weight changes were observed during time 1 (-0.74 ± 4.78kg, p< 0.001), time 2 (2.73 ± 8.06kg, p< 0.001) and time 3 (3.47 ± 7.53kg, p< 0.001). At time 1, almost 50% showed no changes in their weight. At time 2, nearly two-thirds had gained weight and at time 3, 69% had gained weight, abdominal obesity was observed in nearly two-thirds of the women at study entry. A significant difference in weight change among age groups was observed in time 2 and time 3. All ethnic groups had significant weight change in time 1 and time 2. Significant weight gain was observed in relation to body mass index prior to diagnosis, at diagnosis and at study entry. However, no significant difference in weight change by educational level, family history of cancer and cancer stages were observed in all 3 periods. In conclusion, significant weight gain was evident in this sample of women after diagnosis of breast cancer and treatment. Women with breast cancer should be encouraged to maintain normal body mass index and waist circumference through appropriate diet and regular physical activity which may help to reduce their risk of recurrence, secondary cancer and metastasis.},

abstract={A truncating mutation (1100delC) in the cell cycle checkpoint kinase-2 gene, CHEK2, has been identified as a risk factor for familial and sporadic breast cancer in some Northern and Western European populations. However, the prevalence of CHEK2 1100delC in breast cancer appears to be population dependent. We analysed the prevalence of CHEK2 1100delC in 668 breast cancer cases, of which 542 were invasive breast cancers, from a hospital-based cohort of breast cancer patients from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The variant was not found in any patients in this cohort, suggesting that CHEK2 1100delC is rare in our population, and unlikely to contribute significantly to risk to breast cancer among the Malay, Chinese and Indian ethnic groups in Malaysia. This suggests that screening for this allele should not be routinely conducted in Malaysia. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Despite recent advances in treatment, an estimated incidence of 182,460 new cases of invasive breast cancer was expected to occur among women in the US during 2008. The complimented existing clinical treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy are not always that effective and may contribute to significant side effects. Intratumoral infusion is currently the most common method for viral therapy in cancer treatment. Virus dissemination has been reported that it reduces gene expression of the virus in the tumor. The Malaysian heat stable, viscerotropic NDV strain AF2240 has antineoplastic properties and it is currently being tested as an anticancer agent in vivo and in vitro in Malaysia. The objective of this study is to document dissemination of NDV-AF2240 in lung during intratumoral injection in 4T1 xenotransplant breast cancer in BALB/c mice. A total of 300 female BALB/c mice were divided randomly into 15 groups (5 non-cancerous groups, 10 cancerous groups) consisting 20 mice per group. The normal mice (NC), normal treated with 8, 16, 32 and 64 HA units of NDV-AF2240 respectively named as N/NDV8, N/NDV16, N/NDV32 and N/NDV64. The mice in cancerous groups were initially induced with 4T1 cells allograft, NDV-AF2240 and tamoxifen co-culture. Cancerous groups were divided into cancer control (CC), cancer treated with 0.5 μg/mL tamoxifen citrate (CT), cancer treated with 8, 16, 32 and 64 HA units of NDVAF2240 respectively named C/NDV8, C/NDV16, C/NDV32, C/NDV64, cancer treated with 8, 16, 32 and 64 HA units of NDV-AF2240 and tamoxifen respectively as CT/NDV8, CT/NDV16, CT/NDV32 and CT/NDV64 daily for four weeks. Negative staining, polyclonal chicken antibody and goat anti-chicken antibody conjugated with fluorescein isothiocynate (FITC) were successfully used to detect the virus by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) in the breast tumour and lung tissue of CT/NDV32 and CT/NDV64. This reveals that NDV-AF2240 disseminated into lung tissues post intratumoral injection.},

abstract={The genotype analysis of the Gly and Arg allele at codon 388 of fibroblast growth factor receptor-4 (FGFR4) gene was evaluated using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method in a hospital-based Malaysian population. Peripheral blood samples were collected from 387 breast cancer patients and 252 normal and healthy women who had no history of any malignancy. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between the FGFR4 Gly388Arg polymorphism and breast cancer risk as well as clinicopathological parameters of the patients. The Gly/Gly, Gly/Arg, Arg/Arg, and Arg allele genotypes were detected in 46.3%, 44.4%, 9.3%, and 53.7% of breast cancer cases, respectively. The distribution of genotype (p = 0.204) and allele (p = 0.086) frequencies of FGFR4 polymorphism were not significantly different between the breast cancer cases and normal individuals. Women who were Arg/Arg homozygotes (OR = 1.714, 95% CI 0.896-3.278), Gly/Arg heterozygotes (OR = 1.205, 95% CI 0.863-1.683), carriers of Arg allele genotype (OR = 1.269, 95% CI 0.921-1.750), or Arg allele (OR = 1.246, 95% CI 0.970-1.602) were not associated with breast cancer risk. The Arg allele genotype was significantly associated with lymph node metastases (p = 0.001) but not with other clinicopathological parameters. Our findings suggest that the polymorphic variant at codon 388 of FGFR4 gene does not confer increased risk to breast cancer development but it may be a potential genetic marker for tumor prognosis.

abstract={Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 confer an increased risk to breast and other cancers, but to date there have only been limited numbers of studies of BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated cancers among Asians. Malaysia is a multiracial country with three main races: Malays, Chinese, Indians. We determined whether tumor pathologic features and clinical features differ in patients with and without BRCA mutations in this Asian population. We conducted a retrospective review of the medical records of 152 women with breast cancer who underwent genetic testing for BRCA mutations. The patients self-reported ethnicity, age at onset, and clinical stage at diagnosis and tumor pathology were reviewed. A total of 31 patients carried germline deleterious mutations (16 BRCA1, 15 BRCA2). We found that tumors in BRCA1 carriers were more likely to be estrogen receptor (ER)-negative and progesterone receptor (PR)-negative. HER2 was more likely to be negative in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 subjects compared with non-BRCA subjects. We found a strong association between triple-negative status and BRCA1 carriers. In addition, tumors in BRCA1 carriers were more likely to be higher grade than those in BRCA2 and non-BRCA carriers; but the difference was not statistically significant. These results suggest that tumors associated with BRCA1 mutations are distinct from those of BRCA2-associated and non-BRCA-associated breast cancers, and that the tumors associated with BRCA2 mutations are similar to the non-BRCA-associated breast cancers. Further studies are required to determine if the prognosis is different in each of these groups and the best management strategy for each group. © 2009 Société Internationale de Chirurgie.},

abstract={Introduction: Sabah, formerly known as North Borneo, is part of East Malaysia. 52.2 percent of patients with breast cancer in Sabah presented at advanced stages and up to 20.4 percent of patients defaulted proper treatment, opting for traditional therapy. We performed a two-year prospective study looking at the treatment trends of breast cancer in Sabah. Methods: Our subjects were all newly-diagnosed breast cancer cases seen at the hospital in 2005 and 2006. Type of surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy and surgical complication for each patient were studied. Results : Out of 186 newly-diagnosed cases, 152 (81.7 percent) had surgery, 126 (67.7 percent) had chemotherapy, 118 (63.4 percent) had radiotherapy and 92 (49.5 percent) had hormonal therapy. 18.3 percent did not have surgery either due to refusal of treatment or advanced disease. They were more likely to be non-Chinese (91.1 percent, p-value is 0.02). Only 15.8 percent had breast-conserving surgery. The most frequent surgical complication was seroma formation (15.0 percent) . The commonest chemotherapy regime and hormonal therapy were anthracycline-based regime (88.1 percent) and tamoxifen (95.8 percent), respectively. Conclusion: The proportion of breast-conserving surgery and usage of modern adjuvant therapies are low in Sabah. This can be attributed to lack of breast cancer awareness leading to late presentation and refusal of treatment, coupled with insufficient health service funding.},

abstract={Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality and morbidity among women worldwide and IDC (infiltrating ductal carcinoma) is the most common type of invasive breast cancer. The changes in the biological behaviour of cancer tissue can be predicted by measuring the differential protein expression of normal and cancerous tissues. Using a combination of SDS/PAGE and LC (liquid chromatography)-MS/MS (tandem MS), we identified 82 common and differentially expressed proteins from normal and cancerous breast tissues in 20 Malaysian Chinese patients with IDC. These proteins are extracted from the normal and cancerous tissue of patients and therefore represent the actual proteins involved in cancer development. Proteins identified possibly have significant roles in the development of breast cancer in Malaysian Chinese patients in view of their consistent expression in most of the patients, although some of the proteins had not been detected in earlier studies that were mostly carried out in Western countries. This observation suggests that molecular mechanisms leading to breast cancer development in this region may not be identical with those leading to IDC in Western regions. © 2009 Portland Press Ltd.},

abstract={Introduction: The incidence of breast cancer in Asia is rapidly rising. Knowledge and perception often influence attendance at screening programmes. However, there has not been any survey to assess the level of knowledge of breast cancer in an Asian population. Singapore has a multiracial population and is the only Asian country with a national screening programme. We conducted a survey on 1,000 women to assess their level of knowledge and screening practices. Methods: A self-administered questionnaire was used, where one point was given for a correct answer and zero for an incorrect / "not sure " response. The maximum knowledge score was 19. The women were also surveyed for their screening practices. Points were not assigned to questions on practice. Results: The response rate was 100 percent. The mean score was 11.4 and the median was 12 (range 0-19). The scores were high for general knowledge and disease progression, but poor for risk factors, screening, symptoms and treatment. Several myths and misconceptions were prevalent. Only 53 percent did regular breast self-examination (BSE), while 57 percent of women aged 40 years and above had gone for a screening mammogram. Increasing age, Malay race, lower educational level, lower socioeconomic class and not knowing anyone with breast cancer were significant i ndependent predictor s of poor k nowledge. Higher educational level and knowledge scores were signific ant ind ependent predi c tors of BSE practice and screening mammogram attendance. Conclusion: Knowledge affects practice. Public education is required to correct misconceptions and focus on women with poor knowledge. This would help to improve screening attendance rates. breast c ancer knowledge, breast self examination, public education, screening mammogram.},

abstract={Survival after diagnosis of cancer is one of the major outcome measurements and a key criterion for assessing quality of cancer control related to both the preventive and the therapeutic level. The purpose of this study was to determine the 8-year survival time in Malaysia based on socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. A retrospective study of 472 Malaysian women with breast cancer from the Medical Record Department at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre (UKMMC) was therefore performed with survival analysis carried out using the Kaplan-Meier with log-rank test for univariate analysis and Cox-regression for multivariate analysis. Women who had cancer or family history of cancer had a longer 8-year survival time (p = 0.008) compared with others who did not have such a history. Tamoxifen use, positive oestrogen receptor status, and race were prognostic indicators for 8-year survival time (p = 0.036, p = 0.018, p = 0.053, respectively) in univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis showed that being Malays and having no family history of cancer were independent prognostic factors for shorter survival time (p = 0.008, p = 0.012, respectively). In conclusion, being Chinese and having a family history of cancer are predictors of longer survival among the Malaysian breast cancer women.},

abstract={Introduction: Breast cancer is a rare condition among men with a reported incidence of about one percent. Nevertheless, it is thought to behave similarly in both genders. Due to its rarity, male breast cancer is not widely reported, especially in the Asian population. Methods: In a five-year review of our breast cancer surgery series, about 1.6 percent involved male patients. There was a substantial delay in presentation among those men, whose mean age at presentation was 64 years. Results: The majority of patients presented with a painless lump. Histologically, all tumours were ductal in origin and all patients had lower than stage III malignancies. The majority of patients underwent mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection. All male patients were commenced on adjuvant tamoxifen. The longest survival was 54 months with all patients remaining tumour-free. Conclusion: Malaysian men are at risk of breast cancer and seem to have a better prognosis.},

abstract={Objective: Poor health literacy is positively associated with poorer quality of health decision-making and health outcomes in women facing a cancer diagnosis. In developing countries, poor access to complete and accurate information continues to pose a challenge for women. This paper describes the knowledge of Malaysian women with regard to breast cancer and how participation in a self-management program can improve the situation. Methods: Secondary analysis of data collected during a clinical trial on women newly diagnosed with breast cancer (n=147) was performed to examine baseline knowledge of breast cancer profile. Knowledge levels of women in the experimental (n=69) group attending a self-management program were compared to a control group (n=78) to determine change in the level of knowledge over time. Results: At baseline, a high percentage of women were unaware of their breast cancer profile. Not a single woman had knowledge of all six basic characteristics; 83% did not know their HER2 status, type of breast cancer (68%), grade of cancer cell (64%), hormonal receptor status (55%), size of breast cancer (18%) and/or their stage of breast cancer (13%). At post intervention, there was significantly better knowledge within the experimental group. Conclusion: Malaysian women in this cohort study demonstrated very low levels of knowledge of their cancer profile. Clinical implications for countering treatment-decision difficulties include the need for a shift in the way information and services are delivered to allow women to take a more active role in their own care. Multi-modal efforts including basic information dissemination to increase women's knowledge can contribute to narrowing of the gap in health disparity.},

abstract={Objective: The objective of this study was to assess and compare the knowledge and perception of breast cancer among women of various ethnic groups in the state of Penang. Subjects and Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from February 5 to March 15, 2008. 384 participants were conveniently selected and interviewed face to face by a trained researcher (M.A.H.) using a validated questionnaire. Participants were required to answer 22 questions concerning knowledge of breast cancer and 5 questions on the perception of breast cancer management and treatment outcomes. Results: The mean total score of knowledge was 59.1%, with Indian women having significantly less knowledge than the Chinese and Malay women (p < 0.001). Only 117 (32.3%) and 120 (33.0%) women were aware of the recommended breast self-examination (BSE) and clinical breast examination (CBE) guidelines, respectively. Multiple regression analysis showed that ethnicity, age, level of education and employment status were major determinants of breast cancer knowledge. Conclusion: The current study has demonstrated that women in the state of Penang have serious knowledge deficits about breast cancer and poor awareness of BSE and CBE guidelines. This study has highlighted the need of an intensive breast cancer awareness campaign which should also stress the importance of early detection and reporting of breast cancer. © 2009 S.

abstract={The C1772T, G1790A and C111A polymorphisms of Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) gene were analyzed in a hospital-based Malaysian population using PCR-RFLP method. Genomic DNA was extracted from the blood samples collected from 410 breast cancer patients and 275 normal and healthy women. We investigated the association between HIF-1α polymorphisms and breast cancer risk, and clinico-pathological parameters in the population. The genotype and allele frequencies of C1772T (P=0.0093 vs P=0.0024) polymorphism were significantly different between the breast cancer cases and normal subjects but similar association was not observed for G1790A (P>0.05) and C111A (P>0.05) polymorphisms, respectively. Women who were CT heterozygotes (OR=1.51; 95% CI, 1.01-2.25), TT homozygotes (OR=4.03; 95% CI, 1.09-17.60) and carriers of T allele genotype (OR=1.65; 95% CI, 1.13-2.43) were significantly associated with increased risk of breast cancer. Significant relationship was observed also between T allele and breast cancer risk (OR=1.69; 95% CI, 1.20-2.40). Clinicopathological analysis showed that 1772T allele genotype was significantly associated with nodal metastases (P=0.0478) but independent of ER status, tumor grade and patients' age (P>0.05). Our observations suggest that the polymorphic allele of C1772T may be associated with increased risk of developing breast cancer, and presence of 1772T allele may be a useful genetic marker for tumor prognosis.},

abstract={Introduction: This study was conducted to determine the association between serum sex hormone levels and breast cancer. Methods: The study was conducted on newly-diagnosed breast cancer patients who had not received any treatment. Controls were women not known to have any breast disease or hormone-related tumours. Serum hormones were divided into quartiles. Logistic regression adjusting for age and race were done to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95 percent confidence interval (CI). Results: A total of 207 subjects were recruited; 73 premenopausal (37 cases, 36 controls) and 134 postmenopausal (68 cases and 66 controls) women. In the premenopausal women, only serum testosterone was positively associated with breast cancer (OR 1.72, 95 percent CI 0.40-7.40), but this was not a significant finding (p-value is 0.468). In the postmenopausal women, oestradiol, progesterone and testosterone were positively associated with breast cancer with a highest to lowest quartile OR of 1.48, 2.35 and 4.23 (95 percent CI 0.59-3.69, 1.11-4.95 and 1.52-11.78, respectively). The OR was significant for both progesterone and testosterone (p-values of 0.025 and 0.006, respectively). Conclusion: There were no statistically significant findings among the premenopausal cases. In postmenopausal women, serum progesterone and testosterone levels were significantly associated positively with the odds of having breast cancer.},

abstract={Introduction: The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between selenium status and intake among breast cancer patients from the Klang Valley. Methods: 64 cases and 127 controls were matched for age (range 30-65 years) and ethnicity, with an 80 percent study power. Subjects were interviewed to obtain information on their habitual dietary intakes, demographic data and medical history. Selenium status was determined from toenail and hair analysis using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. Results: The nutrient analysis showed that total energy and protein intake was significantly higher among controls (1,403 +/- 367 kcal/day, 75.6 +/-33.2 g/day) as compared to cases (1,273 +/- 295 kcal/day, 60.9 +/- 19.1 g/day) (p-value is less than 0.05). The selenium intake among cases (78.47 +/- 25.34 μg/day) was significantly lower than the controls (89.34 +/- 36.85 μg/day) (p-value is less than 0.05). Breast cancer risk decreased with the increasing quartiles of selenium intake, with odds ratios (95 percent confidence interval) of 2.95 (1.22-7.12), 2.17 (1.13-4.19) and 1.71 (0.84-3.52), respectively. However, the association diminished after adjustment for confounding factors. Selenium in hair did not differ among cases and controls, but selenium status in the nails of controls was significantly higher as compared to cases (p-value is less than 0.05). Breast cancer risk decreased with the increasing quartiles of toenail selenium status as measured in the toenail and hair. Conclusion: Selenium intake and status was associated with breast cancer risk. Thus, it is essential for Malaysian women to achieve a good selenium status by consuming good food sources of selenium as a chemopreventive agent.},

abstract={Axillary nodal status is one of the most important prognostic factors in breast cancer. In the present study we used it to determine the predictors of axillary lymph node metastases in breast cancer and to determine if there is a group of patients in whom minimal axillary surgery is indicated. This article reports a retrospective study of 953 patients with T1 and T2 invasive breast carcinomas seen in the University Malaya Medical Centre between January 2001 and December 2005, where axillary dissection was done. Of the 953 patients, 283 (29.7%) had breast-conserving surgery, and the rest had mastectomies. In this series, 463 patients (48.6%) were younger than 50 years of age; 365 patients (38.3%) had lymph node involvement. The Malays tend to have more axillary node metastases (45.1%) than the Chinese (36.9%); however, there was no significant relationship between age and race and lymph node involvement. Some 23.9% of grade 1 cancers were node positive, compared to 42.9% of grade 2/3 cancers. Tumor size ranged from 0.2 cm to 5 cm; 55.5% of tumors were T2 (>2-5 cm). There were only 13 (1.4%) T1a tumors (>0.1-0.5 cm). Node involvement was documented in 7.7% of T1a tumors, 12.3% of T1b tumors (>0.5-1 cm), 29.2% of T1c tumors, and 48.2% of T2 tumors. In patients who had no lymphovascular invasion (LVI), 24.4% had axillary node metastases, compared with 52.2% of patients where LVI was reported. On univariate analysis, our study found that tumor diameter >2 cm, presence of lymphovascular invasion, and higher tumor grade (2 & 3) were factors significantly associated with a higher risk of nodal metastases. On multivariate analysis, however, only lymphovascular invasion and tumor size were independent predictors based on the logistic regression. In T1 tumors, axillary lymph node dissection will overtreat almost 75% of cases; therefore a sentinel lymph node biopsy is justified in these tumors. Sentinel lymph node biopsy has been shown to reduce the complications of formal axillary dissection, such as shoulder stiffness, pain, and lymphedema.

abstract={Somatic mutations of phosphoinositide-3-kinase, catalytic, α; PIK3CA gene have been reported in several types of human cancers. The majority of the PIK3CA mutations map to the three "hot spots" - E542 K and E545 K in the helical (exon 9) and H1047R in the kinase (exon 20) domains of the p110α. These hot spot mutations lead to a gain of function in PI3 K signaling. We aimed to determine the frequency of PIK3CA mutations in the three most common Malaysian cancers. In this study, we assessed the genetic alterations in the PIK3CA gene in a series of 20 breast carcinomas, 24 colorectal carcinomas, 27 nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPC), and 5 NPC cell lines. We performed mutation analysis of the PIK3CA gene by genomic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and followed by DNA direct sequencing in exons 9 and 20. No mutations were detected in any of the 24 colorectal and 27 NPC samples, but one hot spot mutation located at exon 20 was found in a NPC cell line, SUNE1. Interestingly, PIK3CA somatic mutations were present in 6/20 (30%) breast carcinomas. Two of the six mutations, H1047R, have been reported previously as a hot spot mutation. Only one out of three hot spot mutations were identified in breast tumor samples. The remaining four mutations were novel. Our data showed that a higher incidence rate of PIK3CA mutations was present in Malaysian breast cancers as compared to colorectal and nasopharyngeal tumor tissues. Our findings also indicate that PIK3CA mutations play a pivotal role in activation of the PI3 K signaling pathway in breast cancer, and specific inhibitors of PIK3CA could be useful for breast cancer treatment in Malaysia. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Introduction: Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in Malaysian women, and the use of breast self-examination (BSE), clinical breast examination (CBE) and mammography remain low in Malaysia. Therefore, there is a need to develop a valid and reliable tool to measure the beliefs that influence breast cancer screening practices. The Champion's Health Belief Model Scale (CHBMS) is a valid and reliable tool to measure beliefs about breast cancer and screening methods in the Western culture. The purpose of this study was to translate the use of CHBMS into the Malaysian context and validate the scale among Malaysian women. Methods: A random sample of 425 women teachers was taken from 24 secondary schools in Selangor state, Malaysia. The CHBMS was translated into the Malay language, validated by an expert's panel, back translated, and pretested. Analyses included descriptive statistics of all the study variables, reliability estimates, and construct validity using factor analysis. Results: The mean age of the respondents was 37.2 (standard deviation 7.1) years. Factor analysis yielded ten factors for BSE with eigen-value greater than 1 (four factors more than the original): confidence 1 (ability to differentiate normal and abnormal changes in the breasts), barriers to BSE, susceptibility for breast cancer, benefits of BSE, health motivation 1 (general health), seriousness 1 (fear of breast cancer), confidence 2 (ability to detect size of lumps), seriousness 2 (fear of long-term effects of breast cancer), health motivation 2 (preventive health practice), and confidence 3 (ability to perform BSE correctly). For CBE and mammography scales, seven factors each were identified. Factors for CBE scale include susceptibility, health motivation 1, benefits of CBE, seriousness 1, barriers of CBE, seriousness 2 and health motivation 2. For mammography the scale includes benefits of mammography, susceptibility, health motivation 1, seriousness 1, barriers to mammography seriousness 2 and health motivation 2. Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficients ranged from 0.774 to 0.939 for the subscales. Conclusion: The translated version of the CHBMS was found to be a valid and reliable tool for use with Malaysian women. It can be used easily to evaluate the health beliefs about breast cancer, BSE, CBE and mammography and for planning interventions. For greater applicability, it is recommended that this tool be tested among ethnically diverse populations.},

In addition, the applicability of many risk-assessment tools, such as the Manchester Scoring System and BOADICEA (Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm) which were developed based on mutation rates observed primarily in Caucasian populations using data from multiplex families, and in populations where the rate of breast cancer is higher, has not been widely tested in Asia or in Asians living elsewhere. Here, we report the results of genetic testing for mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes in a series of families with breast cancer in the multi-ethnic population (Malay, Chinese and Indian) of Malaysia.Method: A total of 187 breast cancer patients with either early-onset breast cancer (at age ≤ 40 years) or a personal and/or family history of breast or ovarian cancer were comprehensively tested by full sequencing of both BRCA1 and BRCA2. Two algorithms to predict the presence of mutations, the Manchester Scoring System and BOADICEA, were evaluated.Results: Twenty-seven deleterious mutations were detected (14 in BRCA1 and 13 in BRCA2), only one of which was found in two unrelated individuals (BRCA2 490 delCT). In addition, 47 variants of uncertain clinical significance were identified (16 in BRCA1 and 31 in BRCA2). Notably, many mutations are novel (13 of the 30 BRCA1 mutations and 24 of the 44 BRCA2). We report that while there were an equal proportion of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in the Chinese population in our study, there were significantly more BRCA2 mutations among the Malays. In addition, we show that the predictive power of the BOADICEA risk-prediction model and the Manchester Scoring System was significantly better for BRCA1 than BRCA2, but that the overall sensitivity, specificity and positive-predictive value was lower in this population than has been previously reported in Caucasian populations.Conclusion: Our study underscores the need for larger collaborative studies among non-Caucasian populations to validate the role of genetic testing and the use of risk-prediction models in ensuring that the other populations in the world may also benefit from the genomics and genetics era. © 2008 Thirthagiri et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Background: In Asia, breast cancer is characterised by an early age of onset: In Malaysia, approximately 50% of case occur in women under the age of 50 years. A proportion of these cases may be attributable, at least in part, to genetic components, but to date, the contribution of genetic components to breast cancer in many of Malaysia's ethnic groups has not been well characterised. Methodology: Given that hereditary breast carcinoma is primarily due to germline mutations in one of two breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, we have characterised the spectrum of BRCA mutations in a cohort of 37 individuals with early-onset disease (≤40 years) and no reported family history. Mutational analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 was conducted by full sequencing of all exons and intron-exon junctions. Conclusions: Here, we report a total of 14 BRCA1 and 17 BRCA2 sequence alterations, of which eight are novel (3 BRCA1 and 5 BRCA2). One deleterious BRCA1 mutation and 2 deleterious BRCA2 mutations, all of which are novel mutations, were identified in 3 of 37 individuals. This represents a prevalence of 2.7% and 5.4% respectively, wich is consistent with other studies in other Asian ethnic groups (4-9%). © 2008 Toh et al.},

abstract={Breast cancer is the commonest cancer affecting females in Malaysia, contributing 31% of all newly diagnosed cases amongst Malaysian women. The present retrospective cohort study evaluated the relationship between cerbB-2 onco-protein overexpression with various tumour characteristics and survival rate of breast cancer patients treated at the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre (UKMMC) between 1996-2000. CerbB-2 oncoprotein overexpression was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and tumors showing 2+ positivity were verified by Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH). One hundred and seventy two patients were eligible for the study with a short-term follow-up (median) of 5.1 years. C-erbB-2 oncoprotein overexpression correlated with lymph node positivity, oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) negativity. Univariate analyses showed shorter disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with cerbB-2 oncoprotein overexpression, Malay ethnicity, higher tumour grade, lymph node positivity, ER and PR negativity. In a subgroup of patients with c-erbB-2 oncoprotein overexpression, a shorter OS was observed in those with lymph node positivity, ER and PR negativity. In multivariate prognostic analysis, lymph node status, ER status and tumour grading were the strongest independent prognostic factors for both OS and DFS. However, c-erbB-2 status was not a significantly independent prognostic factor, even in subsets with lymph node positive or negative group. C-erbB-2 oncoprotein overexpression correlated well with lymph node status, ER and PR. Shorter OS and DFS were significantly observed in patients with c-erbB-2 oncoprotein overexpression. Lymph node status, ER status and tumour grading were the only three independent prognostic factors for OS and DFS in this study. Although c-erbB-2 expression is obviously important from a biological standpoint, multivariate analysis showed that it is not an independent prognostic indicator in breast carcinoma in the local population.},

abstract={A cross-sectional study was carried out to determine the knowledge and practices of 425 female secondary school teachers from 20 selected secondary schools in Selangor, Malaysia on breast cancer screening (BCS). A self-administered, structured questionnaire was used for data collection. This study showed moderate to low knowledge on breast cancer (BC) and BCS among teachers. Only 19%, 25% and 13.6% eligible women performed breast self-examination (BSE), clinical breast examination (CBE) and mammography respectively, on a regular basis. Level of breast cancer knowledge was significantly associated with BSE (p=0.000). Having heard/ read about BCS, and regular visit with a physician were associated with BCS behaviors (P<0.05). There was no association between BCS behaviors (P>0.05 and age, family history of breast cancer, marital status or having health insurance). Efforts are needed to increase knowledge and remove misconceptions about breast cancer and screening practices among Malaysian women.},

abstract={Background: Breast cancer is the commonest cancer amongst Malaysian women but local survival data are scarce. The present study was therefore conducted to assess overall survival and prognostic factors in Malaysian breast cancer patients. Methods: The research sample was a prospective cohort of 413 patients diagnosed with breast cancer in the University of Malaya Medical Centre between 1993 to 1997. Survival data were obtained from the National Registry of Birth and Deaths in December 2000. The clinico-pathological variables studied were age, ethnic group, stage, tumour size, lymph node status, oestrogen receptor status and grade. The data was analysed utilizing Splus statistical software. The important prognostic factors were identified by fitting the Cox's proportional hazard model to the data set. Survival probabilities were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and differences were compared by the log-rank test. Results: The overall 5-year survival was 59.1%. The Cox's proportional hazard model identified stage, lymph node status, size and grade as factors that correlated with prognosis. Age was not a significant prognostic factor. The Cox regression model by stepwise selection showed stage, nodal status and grade of tumour to be independent prognostic factors, whereas ethnicity, age and ER status were not. Interpretation: The overall survival in our centre was low. Recognizing factors that affect prognosis of breast cancer patients in Malaysia may improve delivery of health care to at-risk groups by strategizing interventions as survival depends on early detection and effective treatment.},

abstract={Introduction: An important risk factor for developing breast cancer is a positive family history of breast cancer. In Malaysia, there is no population-based breast screening programme, but the clinical practice guidelines suggest increased surveillance for those with a positive family history ie mammography for those 40 years old and above, breast self-examination and clinical breast examination yearly. Objective: To determine if women with a family history of breast cancer present with earlier stages of disease. Methodology: From Jan 2001 to Dec 2006, 1553 women with breast cancer presenting to the University Malaya, where family history was recorded, were eligible for this study. Women with a first or second degree relative with breast cancer were compared with those who have no family history with regard to their race, age, stage, size and duration of symptoms. The Chi Square test of significance was used for analysis. Results: Out of 1553 patients, 252 (16.2%) were found to have a relative with breast cancer out of which 174 (11.2%) had at least one affected first degree relative. There were no significant difference in the incidence of positive family history between the Malays, Chinese and Indians. 20% below the age of 40 years old had a positive family history compared with 12.6% in women with no family history. (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in stage at diagnosis between those with and without family history, ie 24.2% late stages (Stage 3 and 4) in the group with no family history compared with 21.8% in the group with family history. (p>0.05). The mean size in the group with no family history was 4.4 cm compared to 4.1 cm in the group with family history. There was a significant difference in screen-detected cancers in the women with family history, 10.7% compared with 5.1% of screen-detected cancers in the group without a family history. However there was no difference in the duration of symptoms between the 2 groups - 25.8% in the women without a family history presented after 1 year of symptoms compared with 22.4% in the group with a family history (p>0.05). Conclusion: Having a family history of breast cancer does not appear to have much impact on the health-seeking behavior of women. Even though there were more screen detected cancers, these comprised only 10% of the group with family history. Public education should target women at risk ie with family history to encourage these women to present earlier and to undergo screening for breast cancer.},

abstract={Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the association between breast cancer and serum selenium level as well as other risk factors for breast cancer. Methods: A matched case-control study was conducted in a hospital in Malaysia from July 2000 to January 2001 and from May 2001 to June 2001. Sixty-two newly diagnosed breast cancer patients were selected as the cases. Each control, selected from the same hospital population was matched to each case according to age, ethnic group, and menopausal status. Results: The mean selenium concentration among the cases was significantly lower than that among the control. There was a significant association (p<0.05) between breast cancer and low selenium serum level, nulliparity (OR=5.5, 95% CI=1.22 to 24.81), exposure to cigarette smoke (OR=2.2, 95% CI=1.04 to 4.65) and use of oral contraceptives (OR=3.0, 95% CI=1.09 to 8.25) as determined by the McNemar test. Multivariate analysis showed that nulliparity (OR=10.08, 95% CI=1.48 to 68.52) and use of oral contraceptives (OR=3.66, 95% CI=1.36 to 9.87) were associated with increased breast cancer risk. An increased selenium concentration contributes to a reduced risk of breast cancer (OR=0.89, 95% CI=0.84 to 0.94). Conclusion: The results suggest that use of oral contraceptive pills, being nulliparous, and a low serum selenium level are associated with breast cancer.},

abstract={Introduction: Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Asia, and in recent years is emerging as the commonest female malignancy in the developing Asian countries, overtaking cancer of the uterine cervix. There have been no studies objectively comparing data and facts relating to breast cancer in the developed, newly developed, and developing Asian countries thus far. Material and Methods: This multi-national collaborative study retrospectively compared the demographic, clinical, pathological and outcomes data in breast cancer patients managed at participating breast cancer centers in India, Malaysia and Hong Kong. Data, including those on the availability of breast screening, treatment facilities and outcomes from other major cancer centers and cancer registries of these countries and from other Asian countries were also reviewed. Results: Despite an increasing trend, the incidence of breast cancer is lower, yet the cause-specific mortality is significantly higher in developing Asian countries compared with developed countries in Asia and the rest of the world. Patients are about one decade younger in developing countries than their counterparts in developed nations. The proportions of young patients (< 35 years) vary from about 10% in developed to up to 25% in developing Asian countries, which carry a poorer prognosis. In the developing countries, the majority of breast cancer patients continue to be diagnosed at a relatively late stage, and locally advanced cancers constitute over 50% of all patients managed. The stage-wise distribution of the disease is comparatively favorable in developed Asian countries. Pathology of breast cancers in young Asian women and the clinical picture are different from those of average patients managed elsewhere in the world. Owing to lack of awareness, lack of funding, lack of infrastructure, and low priority in public health schemes, breast cancer screening and early detection have not caught up in these under-privileged societies. Conclusions: The inadequacies of health care infrastructures and standards, sociocultural barriers, economic realities, illiteracy, and the differences in the clinical and pathological attributes of this disease in Asian women compared with the rest of the world together result in a different spectrum of the disease. Better socioeconomic conditions, health awareness, and availability of breast cancer screening in developed Asian countries seem to be the major causes of a favorable clinical picture and outcomes in these countries. © 2007 Société Internationale de Chirurgie.},

abstract={The p27 V109G polymorphism was investigated using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method in a hospital-based Malaysian population. Peripheral blood samples were collected from 230 breast cancer patients and 200 normal and healthy women who had no history of breast disease or breast cancer. We evaluated the association between the p27 polymorphism and breast cancer risk, and clinico-pathological parameters in the population. The distribution of genotype and allele frequencies of p27 V109G polymorphism were not significantly different between the breast cancer cases and normal subjects (P=0.376). Women who were homozygous (OR=1.73; 95% CI, 0.62-4.92) or heterozygous (OR=1.26; 95% CI, 0.75-2.12) for G allele, or carriers of G allele genotype (OR=1.34; 95%, 0.83-2.16) or G allele (OR=1.36; 95% CI, 0.90-2.05) were not associated with breast cancer risk. No significant correlation was noted between G allele genotype and breast cancer risk among patients under 50 (OR=1.28; 95% CI, 0.62-2.66) or 50 years and older (OR=1.38; 95%o CI, 0.71-2.66) at diagnosis. The G allele genotype was significantly associated with lymph node metastases but independent of ER status and histological grade. In conclusion, the polymorphic variant at codon 109 of p27 gene may not be a marker for determining patients' risk of developing breast cancer but it may be a potential genetic marker for poor prognosis, thereby a marker for tumor prognosis.},

abstract={The message that health care providers caring for patients with breast cancer would like to put forth, is that, not only early detection is crucial but early treatment too is important in ensuring survival. This paper examines the pattern of presentation at a single institution over a 10-year period from 1995 to 2005. In Malaysia, education outreach programmes are ongoing, with contributions not only from the public sector, but also private enterprise. Articles on breast cancer in local newspapers and women magazines and television are quite commonplace. However are our women getting the right message? Now is an appropriate time to bring the stakeholders together to formulate a way to reach all women in Malaysia, not excluding the fact that we are from different races, different education levels and backgrounds requiring differing ways of delivering health promotion messages. To answer the question of why women present late, we prospectively studied 25 women who presented with locally advanced disease. A quantitative, quasi-qualitative study was embarked upon, as a prelude to a more detailed study. Reasons for presenting late were recorded. We also looked at the pattern of presentation of breast lumps in women to our breast clinic in UMMC and in the surgical clinic in Hospital Kota Bharu, in the smaller capital of the state of Kelantan, in 2003. There is hope for the future, the government being a socially responsible one is currently making efforts towards mammographic screening in Malaysia. However understanding of the disease, acceptance of medical treatment and providing resources is imperative to ensure that health behaviour exhibited by our women is not self-destructive but self-preserving. Women are an integral part of not only the nation's workforce but the lifeline of the family - hopefully in the next decade we will see great improvement in the survival of Malaysian women with breast cancer.},

abstract={Introduction: Malaysian women have a 1 in 20 chance of developing breast cancer in their lifetime. Sabah, formerly known as North Borneo, is part of East Malaysia with a population of 3.39 million and more than 30 ethnic groups. We conducted a 2 year prospective epidemiological study to provide unreported data of breast cancer from this part of the world and to recognise which particular group of patients are more likely to present with advanced diseas. Methods: All newly diagnosed breast cancers seen at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Kota Kinabalu, from January 2005 to December 2006 were included in th study. Patient and tumour characteristics, including age, race, education, socioeconomic background, parity, practice of breast feeding, hormonal medication intake, menopausal status, family history, mode of presentation, histology, grade, stage of disease and hormonal receptors status were collected and analysed. Results: A total of 186 patients were seen. The commonest age group was 40 to 49 years old (32.3%). Chinese was the commonest race (30.6%) followed by Kadazan-Dusun (24.2%). The commonest histology was invasive ductal carcinoma (88.4%). Stages at presentation were Stage 0-4.8%, Stage I- 12.9%, Stage II- 30.1%, Stage III- 36.6% and Stage IV- 15.6%. The estrogen and progesterone receptor status was positive in 59.1% and 54.8% of cases, respectively. 73.7% of Chinese patients presented with early cancer compared to 36.4% of the other races. Patients who presented with advanced disease were also poor, non-educated and from rural areas. 20.4% of patients defaulted treatment; most of them opted for traditional alternatives. Conclusions: Sabahan women with breast cancer present late. Great efforts are needed to improve public awareness of breast cancer, especially among those who have higher risk of presenting with advanced disease.},

abstract={Naturalistic inquiry using focus group interviews was undertaken to explore experiences and perceived barriers to self management in women with breast cancer. The aim was to identify their perceived barriers to self management to aid the development of rehabilitation programmes. Successful programmes are strongly linked to patients' perceived needs. Four focus groups consisted of 39 women, were purposively recruited. Women's needs within the three areas of medical, emotional and role management of breast cancer were explored. The main barriers were unavailability of information, inability to access services-and-support, and socioeconomic-cultural issues (entrenched myths, low-socioeconomic status, and inadequate insurance-health legislative coverage). The findings provide the critically lacking 'expert-view' of survivors, who verified the importance of the medical, emotional and role management tasks, and highlighted barriers and structural solutions. With breast cancer becoming recognised as a form of chronic illness, this study is timely.},

abstract={Background: From 1968 to 2002, Singapore experienced an almost three-fold increase in breast cancer incidence. This increase appeared to be different across the three main ethnic groups: Chinese, Malays and Indians. This paper used age-period-cohort (APC) modelling, to determine the effects of age at diagnosis, calendar period, and birth cohort on breast cancer incidence for each ethnic group. Methods: This study included all breast cancer cases (n = 15,269) in the three ethnic groups, reported to the Singapore Cancer Registry from 1968 to 2002 between the ages 25 to 79. Age-specific fertility rates from the Department of Statistics were used to explore the role of fertility. Results: In the 1970s, Indian women had the highest age-standardized breast cancer but by the mid-1980s the highest rates were seen among the Chinese. Remarkable differences were seen in the age-specific incidence rates by ethnic groups. After age 49, the incidence rates for the Chinese and Malays leveled off whereas it continued to rise in the Indians. While our analyses provided some evidence that an age-drift model described the trend seen in the Indians, age-period-cohort model and age-cohort model had the best fit for the Chinese and Malays aged 25 to 79 respectively. Overall, Chinese and Malay women born in later cohorts were at increased risk of developing breast cancer relative to their counterparts in the earlier cohorts. The three ethnic groups experienced similar changes in their fertility in the 1970s, which likely explained much of the increase in their breast cancer incidence but not the ethnic differences. There was a stronger inverse association between total fertility rate and pre-menopausal breast cancer incidence in the Chinese and Malays than the Indians. Conclusion: The observed dissimilarity among ethnic groups suggests ethnic differences in exposure or response to certain risk factors.

abstract={Breast cancer is the most common female cancer and the commonest cause of death due to cancer for women in Malaysia. This study was performed to identify the relationship with lifestyle factors. A case-control study was conducted among females with breast cancer who came for treatment to the Breast Clinic Hospital Kuala Lumpur in July until September 2004. A total of 203 female patients were recruited as cases along with 203 patients who attended the Outpatient Clinic, Hospital Kuala Lumpur during the study period as the controls. The study showed women who did not exercise regularly to have four times higher risk (adjusted odds ratio is 3.49, 95% CI is 1.84 to 6.62) compared to those who exercised regularly. Women with a high fat diet were also at elevated risk (adjusted odds ratio 3.84, 95% CI is 1.20 to 12.34) compared to those consuming a low fat diet. Woman without breast cancer generally had a longer duration of lifetime lactation with a median of thirty-three months compared to woman with breast cancer (twenty months, p<0.05). Women who did not take oral contraceptive pills but had breast-fed their child have a 56.0% lower risk (crude odds ratio 0.44, CI is 0.22 to 0.87) compared to women who did not take oral contraceptive pill and also did not breast-fed their child. If they had breast fed for thirteen months and above, they faced a 61.0% lower risk (crude odds ratio 0.39, 95% CI is 0.17 to 0.87). There was a significant inverse trend for lifetime lactation and breast cancer risk. In conclusion certain life styles of women are associated with a higher risk of breast cancer development. Therefore, the promotion of a healthy life style should be emphasized.},

abstract={Aim: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis if longer CA dinucleotide repeats are more common in the Asian population and also to gain insights into the interplay between the CA dinucleotide repeats and the frequencies of EGFR gene expression and amplifications as this might have therapeutic implications with regards to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Materials and Methods: The EGFR intron 1 polymorphism was analysed in three distinct healthy Asian subjects, namely, Chinese (N = 96), Malays (N = 98) and Indians (N = 100). Comparative genomic hybridisation was performed to investigate for changes in DNA copy number in relation to the polymorphic CA dinucleotide repeats in breast tumor tissues (N = 22). Results: The frequency of short alleles with 14 and 15 CA repeats were most common in the Asian populations and significantly higher than those reported for Caucasians. The frequency of 20 CA repeats was 5%, almost 13-fold lower than previous reports. EGFR amplifications were detected in 23% and 11% of breast tumor tissues harboring short and long CA repeats, respectively. Conclusion: Our results show that the frequency of alleles encoding for short CA dinucleotide repeats is common in Asian populations. EGFR expression and amplification levels were also higher in Asian breast tumor tissues with short CA dinucleotide repeats. These findings suggest that the EGFR intron 1 polymorphism may influence response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors in breast cancer patients and further studies are warranted. ©2006 Landes Bioscience.},

abstract={Introduction: Breast cancer is the commonest cancer for females in Malaysia, with a prevalence of 86.2 per 100,000 women in 1996. Breast cancer mortality rate shows an increasing trend in Malaysia from 0.61 in 1983 to 1.8 per 100,000 women in 1992. The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors for breast cancer in women in Malaysia. Methods: A matched case-control study was carried out at referral hospitals in Kelantan from July 2000 to June 2001. A standardised questionnaire that comprised socio-demographical factors, obstetrical and gynaecological histories, anthropometric measurements, and other potential risk factors for breast cancer, was used to interview 147 histologically-confirmed breast cancer patients and 147 controls. Controls were non-breast cancer patients who were matched for age and ethnicity, and excluded those with malignancies, or having gynaecological, hormonal or endocrine problems. Simple and multiple conditional logistic regressions were used for analyses. Results: Factors contributing toward increased risk of breast cancer were nulliparity (odds ratio [OR] of 15.3; 95 percent confidence interval [CI] of 3.2, 72.4), overweight (OR of 2.1; 95 percent CI of 1.1, 3.9), family history of breast cancer (OR of 4.3; 95 percent CI of 1.3, 14.1) and previous use of oral contraceptives (OR of 2.5; 95 percent CI of 1.3, 4.8). Conclusion: This study reconfirmed that similar risk factors identified in Western populations were responsible for the occurrence of breast cancer in Kelantan. It also supported the theory that breast cancer occurrence was related to oestrogen exposure and familial factors. It suggested the importance of having children, maintaining ideal body weight and caution for oral contraceptive users and women with a family history of breast cancer.},

abstract={Little is known about the information needs of women with breast cancer in non-Western societies. This study examined the priority information needs of 100 women with breast cancer in Malaysia and compared the findings to previous work involving 150 women diagnosed with breast cancer in the United Kingdom. The study used a valid and reliable measure, the Information Needs Questionnaire (INQ). The INQ contained 9 items of information related to physical, psychological, and social care, used successfully in Canada and the United Kingdom. The INQ was shown to have cross-cultural relevance and sensitivity. For Malaysian women, information about likelihood of cure, sexual attractiveness, and spread of disease were the most important information needs. For UK women, similar priorities were evident, apart from the item on sexual attractiveness, which was ranked much lower by women in the United Kingdom. The cultural similarities and differences that emerged from this study have implications for nurses in the cancer field caring for people from a diversity of cultural backgrounds. Breast care nurses are not a feature of the Malaysian healthcare system, although the findings from this study support the view that specialist nurses have a vital role to play in meeting the psychosocial needs of women with breast cancer in non-Western societies. © 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.},

abstract={Bioassay guided fractionation of the roots of Cyathostemma argenteum using the brine shrimp resulted in the isolation of two uncommon flavanones, 2,5-dihydroxy-7-methoxyflavanone 1 and 2,5-dihydroxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavanone 2 while the stem bark yielded the related compounds 5-hydroxy-7-methoxyflavone 3 and 5-hydroxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavone 4. The alkaloids liriodenine 5 and discretamine 6 as well as benzyl benzoate 7 were isolated from the roots and 6 was also isolated from the stembark. In cytotoxicity tests using four human breast cancer cell lines, 1 and 2 were weakly toxic to MCF-7 cells (IC 50 = 19.6 and 19.0 μm, respectively) but showed little activity against MCF-7 cells resistant to doxorubicin or against two oestrogen receptor-deficient cell lines. Compound 5, but not 6 and 7, was moderately cytotoxic against all four cell lines. These results are discussed in the context of the traditional use of C. argenteum in the treatment of breast cancer.

abstract={Breast cancer is one of the commonest cancers among women in Malaysia. The relation between lifestyle practices and the risk of breast cancer in Chinese women aged 21-55 years were assessed using data collected from June to October 2001, via a face-to face interview in a case control study in the Breast Clinics of Kuala Lumpur Hospital and University Malaya Medical Centre. A total of 89 cases with breast cancer were compared with 85 controls without the disease. Our study showed that breastfeeding had an odds ratio of 4.43 after adjustment for confounders. The results add to the evidence of a protective association between breast feeding practices and breast cancer particularly among Chinese women receiving treatment at two government hospitals in the Klang Valley.},

abstract={Breast cancer is the most common cancer among Malaysian women. There is a marked geographical difference in the worldwide incidence of breast cancer, with a higher incidence in developed countries compared to developing countries. From 1998 to 2001, new cases of breast cancer presenting to the breast clinics at Hospital Kuala Lumpur and University Malaya Medical Centre, Malaysia, were reviewed; the race, age and stage at presentation were analysed. Of 774 cases seen in Hospital Kuala Lumpur, only 5.2% (40/774) were impalpable breast cancers diagnosed on mammography. The prevalent age group was 40 to 49 years, and the median age was 50 years. The average size of the tumour was 5.4 cm in diameter. Malay women appear to have larger tumours and a later stage at presentation than other ethnic groups; 50% to 60% were in late stages (Stages 3 and 4). During the same period, 752 new cases of breast cancer were seen in the University Malaya Medical Centre. The average tumour size was 4.2 cm, and 30% to 40% were in late stages. The age incidence was similar. The delay in presentation of breast cancer was attributed to a strong belief in traditional medicine, the negative perception of the disease, poverty and poor education, coupled with fear and denial. A prospective, population-based study is required to determine the demographic pattern of breast cancer and the factors delaying presentation. These findings will have important implications in future programmes to promote the early detection of breast cancer, as well as in understanding geographical as well as racial variations in the incidence of breast cancer.},

abstract={Breast cancer is the most common cancer among Malaysian women. Nonetheless, in Malaysia there is a marked geographical difference in the incidence of breast cancer with advanced stage of presentation. The breast clinic in Kuala Lumpur Hospital diagnosed approximately 150 to 200 new cases of breast cancer a year. This number, however, represents only 12.0% to 15.0% of all breast disease seen annually in Kuala Lumpur Hospital. Between 1998 and 2001, of a total of 774 cases of newly diagnosed breast cancer in Kuala Lumpur Hospital, only 5.0% (40/774) were impalpable breast cancers. The peak age group for the three major ethnic distributions (Malay, Chinese, and Indian) ranged from 40 to 49 years. The mean tumor size at presentation was 5.4 cm (range: 1-20 cm), and the advanced stage of breast cancer is observed to be highest among the Malay ethnic group. Although it appears that the incidence of breast cancer in Malaysia is lower than in the developed countries, the difference may be attributable to the difficulty in getting accurate statistics and to underreporting of cases. Nonetheless, from the available data, it is clear that breast cancer continues to be the most common cancer among Malaysian women. The strongly negative social-cultural perception of the disease, made worse by the geographical isolation of many rural areas, accounts for the delayed diagnosis and the often advanced stage of disease at presentation. A prospective population-based study is called for to verify the demographic patterns of breast cancer, particular in Malaysia and other developing countries. The findings of such a study may have implications for future breast screening programs and for facilitating the understanding of differing risks of breast cancer among women around the world.},

abstract={OBJECTIVE: To study the impact of various clinicopathological factors on short-term survival in a cohort of breast cancer patients treated at the University of Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC). METHODS: All cases of breast cancer treated at UMMC from January 1999 to June 2001, except for stage IV disease, were included in the study. Survival analysis was carried out using Kaplan-Meier for univariate analysis and Cox regression for multivariate analysis. The log-rank test was used to test the significance of differences between the different survival curves. RESULTS: A total of 385 patients were included. The mean patient age at presentation was 50.3 years (SD, 11.4); 198 (51.4%) patients had lymph node-positive disease, and 187 (48.6%) had node-negative disease. The mean follow-up period was 18.7 months (SD, 8.8). The Malay ethnic group, tumours of larger size, node-positive disease, more than five positive lymph nodes, oestrogen receptor (ER) negativity and the presence of lymphovascular invasion were significant prognostic factors for shorter recurrence-free survival (RFS) in the univariate analysis. In the multivariate analysis, ER negativity was the only independent adverse prognostic factor for RFS. For overall survival (OS), tumours of larger size, node-positive disease, more than five positive lymph nodes, ER negativity and high grade tumours were associated with significantly shorter OS. However, more than five positive lymph nodes was the only independent prognostic factor for shorter OS in the multivariate analysis. Further multivariate analysis of the patients with node-positive disease showed that the Malay ethnic group, ER negativity and more than five positive lymph nodes were independent prognostic factors for shorter RFS. On the other hand, ER negativity and more than five positive lymph nodes were independent negative prognostic factors for OS in this subgroup of patients. CONCLUSION: The evaluation of various prognostic factors would provide useful information on disease progression in local patients, especially for the planning of adjuvant therapies and follow-up protocols. Differences in the pattern of breast cancer among the different ethnic groups in Malaysia warrant further studies.},

abstract={The mutation spectrum of the BRCA1 gene among ethnic groups from Asia has not been well studied. We investigated the frequency of mutations in the BRCA1 gene among Malay breast cancer patients from Singapore, independent of family history. By using the protein truncation test (PTT) and direct sequencing, BRCA1 mutations were detected in 6 of 49 (12.2%) unrelated patients. Four novel missense mutations in exon 11, T557A (1788A>G), T582A (1863A>G), N656S (2086A>G) and P684S (2169C>T) were identified in one patient. Two patients had missense mutations in exon 23, V1809A (5545T>C), which has been previously detected in individuals from Central and Eastern Europe. Three unrelated patients had the deleterious 2846insA frameshift mutation in exon 11. Methylation specific PCR (MSP) of the promoter region of the BRCA1 gene detected hypermethylation of tumor DNA in an additional 2 patients. Haplotype analysis using the microsatellite markers D17S855, D17S1323 and D17S1325 revealed a common haplotype for the three unrelated patients and their three relatives with the 2846insA mutation. These findings strongly suggest that the 2846insA mutation, the most common deleterious mutation in this study, may possibly be a founder mutation in breast cancer patients of Malay ethnic background.

abstract={Background: Recent advances in diagnosis and treatment of cancer have led to an increase in cancer survival, and hence, there is a greater emphasis on quality beside quantity of survival. Developing countries too have begun to recognize the need for monitoring quality of life (QOL). However, in most of the developing countries, a validated and reliable tool for the purpose is yet to be realized. Material and method: The functional assessment of chronic illness therapy (FACIT) system is a collection of QOL questionnaires targeted to measure QOL in chronic illness. The functional assessment of cancer therapy for breast cancer (FACT-B) was translated into the local language (Malayalam) and tested for validity and reliability. Results: The tool thus developed showed substantial sensitivity, as does the source tool. The Cronbach's α for the total FACT-B was 0.87, which is similar to the α of 0.9 observed in the FACT-B English version. The mean FACT-B score was 94.3 compared to 112.8 for the source tool. Conclusion: The Malayalam translation of the FACT-B questionnaire was developed, tested and validated, and was found satisfactory in comparison to the source tool.},

One goal is to promote breast surgery world wide and focus on the situation in the developing countries. An edited summary of a symposium on locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) and the current situation in two African countries and in Malaysia is reported. Diagnosis, management and treatment options differ from recommendations that prevail due to lack of resources, lack of access to facilities and cultural and socioeconomic barriers. Younger age at onset, more men are affected and locally advanced breast cancer dominates the clinical panorama. A rational treatment plan for LABC should have chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy and hormonal therapy as armaments. A unique opportunity exists for international interchange within a professional organization such as BSI, for providing training opportunities, for clinical and experimental studies of the world's most common female malignancy.},

abstract={Overexpression and amplification of cyclin D1 were investigated by immunohistochemistry and differential polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) in 440 formalin-fixed primary breast carcinoma tissues. Overexpression of cyclin D1 was detected in 60% (263/440) and amplification of cyclin D1 was noted in 27% (119/440) of the primary breast carcinomas. Molecular analysis demonstrated that cyclin D1 was amplified in 30% (7/23) of the comedo DCIS, 22% (9/41) of the comedo DCIS and 32% (13/41) of the adjacent invasive ductal carcinomas, 30% (82/270) of the invasive ductal carcinomas, 27% (9/33) of the invasive lobular carcinomas, 19% (4/21) of the colloid carcinomas and 13% (2/15) of the medullary carcinomas. Cyclin D1 was amplified in 11% (2/19) of the invasive ductal carcinomas but not in the adjacent non-comedo DCIS lesions. Our observation showed that cyclin D1 was strongly positive in 61% (14/23) of the comedo subtype, 61% (11/18) of the non-comedo subtype, 59% (24/41) of the comedo DCIS and 63% (26/41) of the adjacent invasive ductal carcinomas, 53% (10/19) of the non-comedo DCIS and 58% (11/19) of the adjacent invasive lesions, 58% (157/270) of the invasive ductal carcinomas, 73% (24/33) of the invasive lobular carcinomas, 52% (11/21) of the colloid carcinomas and 27% (4/15) of the medullary carcinomas. A significant association was observed between in situ components and adjacent invasive lesions for cyclin D1 expression (p<0.05) and amplification (p<0.05). A significant relationship was noted between amplification of cyclin D1 and lymph node metastases (p<0.05) but not with histological grade (p<0.05), estrogen receptor status (p<0.05) and proliferation index (Ki-67 and PCNA) (p>0.05). However, overexpression of cyclin D1 was statistically associated with well differentiated tumors (p<0.05) and estrogen receptor positivity (p<0.05). No relationship was seen with nodal status (p>0.05) and proliferation index (Ki-67 and PCNA) (p>0.05). These observations suggest that tumors positive for cyclin D1 protein may have features of good prognosis but amplification of cyclin D1 gene could be an indicator of tumors with poor prognostic features. Although majority of the Malaysian patients belong to younger age group (<50 years old), amplification and expression of cyclin D1 was not statistically associated with patient age (p>0.05). These observations indicate that amplification and up-regulation of cyclin D1 may be independent of patient age. Moreover, overexpression and amplification of cyclin D1 in preinvasive, preinvasive and adjacent invasive lesions, and invasive carcinomas suggest that the gene may play an important role in early and late stages of breast carcinogenesis.},

abstract={Oestrone sulphate is a major source of active oestrogens in the breast. It is converted to oestrone by oestrone sulphatase. Breast cyst fluid (BCF) is a rich source of sex hormones and growth factors. BCF obtained from British women has been shown to inhibit oestrone sulphatase activity in the MCF-7 oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer cell line. The aim of the present study was to assess whether BCF obtained from Malaysian women inhibited oestrone sulphatase activity in the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. The cell lines were grown in supplemented Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium for 3 days, following which a 3-day incubation with sterilised BCF was carried out. At the end of the treatment period the cell monolayers were assayed for oestrone sulphatase activity and the number of cell nuclei counted on a Coulter Counter. BCF was also fractionated on a Bio-Sil SEC 125-5 column by HPLC and the effects of the fractions collected on oestrone sulphatase activity in the MDA-MB-231 cell line were assessed. All 18 samples of BCF tested inhibited cell growth in the MDA-MB-231 cell line while 8 out of 10 samples inhibited MCF-7 cell growth; 15 out of 18 BCF samples inhibited oestrone sulphatase activity in the MDA-MB-231 cell line whereas 5 out of 10 samples stimulated oestrone sulphatase activity in the MCF-7 cell line. HPLC fractions corresponding to molecular weights of > 158 kDa and 28 kDa were found to inhibit oestrone sulphatase activity in the MDA-MB-231 cell line. Further work is required to fully characterise these substances as they may have roles to play in the prevention of breast cancer.},

abstract={Amplification of int-2/FGF-3 gene was investigated by differential polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) in 440 archival primary breast carcinoma tissues. Of these, 23 were comedo ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), 18 were non-comedo DCIS, 41 were comedo DCIS with adjacent invasive ductal carcinomas, 19 were non-comedo DCIS with adjacent invasive ductal carcinomas, 270 were invasive ductal carcinomas, 33 were invasive lobular carcinomas, 21 were colloid carcinomas and 15 were medullary carcinomas. Int-2 was amplified in 22% (96/440) of the primary breast carcinomas. It was shown that int-2 was amplified in 13% (3/23) of the comedo DCIS, 17% (7/41) of the comedo DCIS and 29% (12/41) of the adjacent invasive ductal carcinomas, 26% (71/270) of the invasive ductal carcinomas, 18% (6/33) of the invasive lobular carcinomas, 10% (2/21) of the colloid carcinomas and 13% (2/15) of the medullary carcinomas. In contrast, int-2 was not amplified in non-comedo DCIS and invasive ductal carcinomas with adjacent non-comedo DCIS lesions. A significant association was observed between int-2 amplification in the in situ components and adjacent invasive lesion (P<0.05). All tumors with int-2 amplification in the in situ lesions (7/7) also demonstrated same degree of amplification in the adjacent invasive components. However, 9% (5/53) of the tumors with no amplified int-2 gene in the in situ components showed int-2 amplification in the adjacent invasive lesions. A significant relationship was noted between amplification of int-2 and lymph node metastases (P<0.05) and poorly differentiated tumors (P<0.05) but not with estrogen receptor status (P>0.05) and proliferation index (Ki-67 and PCNA) (P>0.05). In Malaysia, majority of the patients belong to younger age group (<50 years old) but a comparison of the age groups showed that the amplification of int-2 was not statistically associated with patient age (P>0.05). These observations indicate that amplification of int-2 tends to strengthen the view that int-2 may have the potential to be an indicator of poor prognosis regardless of the age of the patient. Moreover, the presence of int-2 amplification in preinvasive, preinvasive and adjacent invasive lesions, and invasive carcinomas suggest that int-2 could be a marker of genetic instability occurring in early and late stages of tumor development.},

abstract={Presentation of breast cancer during pregnancy is a rare situation and one that requires a multidisciplinary approach involving an obstetrician, surgeon and oncologist. Management should be along the same principles as in non-pregnant patients and delay is not justifiable. Mastectomy and axillary clearance is the best option, followed by chemotherapy, which is safe after the first trimester. Radiation if required should be delayed until after delivery of the baby. We present here our experience with 6 patients who presented with breast cancer during pregnancy. Five patients refused any treatment until after delivery, while one underwent only a mastectomy and axillary clearance. The outcome was poor; all of them died between 14 months and 52 months. The poor outcome probably reflects the late stage at presentation in four of the patients (State 3 and 4) rather than the delay in treatment, while delay in treatment in the two who presented with early cancer (Stage 1 and 2) led to a more advanced stage after delivery.},

abstract={Background: Endometrial changes have been observed when tamoxifen is used as an adjuvant therapy for carcinoma of the breast in postmenopausal women with positive estrogen receptors status. Aim of Study: The aim of this study was to evaluate endometrial response in similar patients in Malaysia. Patients: Between February - July 1995, 38 women who had been receiving tamoxifen therapy were analysed for endometrial thickness by transvaginal ultrasonography and histopathological changes in endometrial biopsy samples. The results were compared with a similar group of postmenopausal women who did not have carcinoma of the breast. In the study group, tamoxifen was administered daily at a dose of 20 - 40 mg. All patients were above 50 years of age. The mean duration of tamoxifen therapy was 21.2 months (range 8 - 36 months). Results: Detectable differences in endometrial thickness were seen between tamoxifen and control groups. Eighteen (47%) patients in the study group had endometrial thickness in excess of 10 mm; the mean thickness being 10.7 mm (± 4.95 mm) which was significantly greater than the control group. Positive histological findings were found in 17 patients (45%) compared to 7 patients (18%) in the control group. Endometrium was reported to be atrophic when endometrial thickness was less than 5 mm. The study underscores the need for endometrial surveillance in breast cancer patients who are on continuous tamoxifen therapy for more than 12 months and have an endometrial thickness exceeding 8 mm.},

abstract={Background. Breast cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer among women in Singapore, a country which has experienced significant changes in lifestyle over the past three decades. The increase in incidence of the disease is a matter of some concern. Methods. Data from the population-based Singapore Cancer Registry for 1968-1992 were used to determine time trends, inter-ethnic differences and the contributions of age, period and cohort effects to the incidence of the disease. Results. Our results revealed an average annual increase of 3.6% over the 25-year period for all women, from 20.2 per 100,000 women in the period 1968-1972 to 38.8 per 100,000 in 1988-1992. There was a statistically significant difference between the three major ethnic groups, the rate of increase being highest in Malays (4.4%) and lowest in Indians (1.4%). The overall increase was attributable to a strong cohort effect that remained significant when adjusted for time period for Chinese women and for all ethnic groups combined. The risk was observed to increase in successive birth cohorts from the 1890s to the 1960s. Conclusions. Our results suggest that breast cancer incidence rates are likely to continue to increase more sharply in the future as women born after the mid-20th century reach the high-risk age groups. They also suggest the pattern by which important aetiological factors for the disease in our population have exerted their effects, and provide support for the role of demographic and lifestyle changes as possible risk factors.},

In the study, 73.6% of patients had surgery as the primary treatment, and of these, 30.4% had conservation surgery. The majority of patients had adjuvant therapy. Patients with locally advanced and metastatic disease had chemotherapy as the primary treatment. Of the 116 patients who were eventually followed up for a short period of 18 months to 34 months, there was a mortality rate of 20.7% and a recurrence rate of 10.3%.},
